## Purpose

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/engineering/05-purpose.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** none

```markdown
## Purpose

[1–2 paragraphs explaining this document's role in the documentation ecosystem,
its scope boundaries, and how it differs from adjacent standards]
```

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05), adjacent documentation standards

### Examples

**Correct:**
> This document defines Engineering Documentation's role in the documentation ecosystem. It establishes repository-wide engineering decisions, implementation standards, technology selection rationale, and development conventions. Unlike Feature Technical Design, Engineering Documentation is not feature-specific — it provides reusable knowledge that governs the entire repository.

**Incorrect:**
> This document describes the login page implementation, including the OAuth2 flow, JWT token storage, and session management using Redis.
> *Why wrong: This is feature-specific and describes implementation details, not the repository-wide role of Engineering Documentation in the ecosystem.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** structural
- **Voice:** third person
- **Structure:** paragraphs
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Define the document's role in the documentation ecosystem explicitly; distinguish Engineering Documentation from adjacent standards (Architecture, Feature Technical Design); set clear scope boundaries with what is included and excluded
- **Don't:** Include implementation details or feature-specific content; blur boundaries with adjacent documentation standards; describe what the document contains rather than why it exists

---

This document defines the standard for Engineering Documentation within the engineering documentation ecosystem.

Engineering Documentation describes the repository-wide engineering decisions, implementation standards, technology selection rationale, development conventions, and operational practices required to realize the documented architecture.

Unlike Feature Technical Design, Engineering Documentation is **not feature specific**.

Instead, it provides reusable engineering knowledge that governs the implementation of the entire repository.

Engineering Documentation explains **why the repository is engineered this way**.

It does not describe feature implementations.

## Build Standards

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/engineering/03-build_standards.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 2 subsections
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** flowchart

```markdown
## Build Standards

> [metadata block]

### Build System

[1–2 paragraphs: build tool, configuration, rationale for choice]

### Pipeline Stages

> **diagram:** flowchart of pipeline stages

[1 paragraph per stage explaining purpose, inputs, outputs, quality gates]

### Quality Gates

[Optional: criteria that must pass before proceeding]
```

**Required subsections:** Build System, Pipeline Stages
**Optional subsections:** Quality Gates
**Required diagrams:** Pipeline flowchart
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05), Testing Standards

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Build System:** The repository uses a task runner configured via `build.config.toml`. Each pipeline stage runs in an isolated container to ensure reproducibility. The compile stage produces a deterministic artifact; the lint stage enforces style rules; the test stage runs the full test suite. Rationale: deterministic builds ensure that any commit produces the same artifact regardless of the build environment.

**Incorrect:**
> **Build System:** We use Jenkins. Our pipeline is: checkout → build → deploy to staging.
> *Why wrong: Missing rationale, missing quality gates, describes deployment which is out of scope, and does not explain why the pipeline is structured this way.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** prescriptive
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** mixed
- **Audience:** engineer
- **Do:** Document each pipeline stage with purpose, inputs, outputs, and quality gates; explain the rationale for each stage; include a pipeline flowchart showing stage ordering
- **Don't:** Describe deployment or release details that are out of scope; omit quality gates between stages; list pipeline stages without explaining why they exist

*(To be written by the domain expert. This section defines the repository-wide build process, CI/CD pipeline, and build tooling standards.)*

---

## Testing Standards

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/engineering/04-testing_standards.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 2 subsections
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** flowchart

```markdown
## Testing Standards

> [metadata block]

### Test Types

[1 paragraph per test type: unit, integration, e2e — purpose, scope, tooling]

### Coverage Expectations

[1 paragraph: coverage targets, what is measured, thresholds]

### Test Tooling

[Optional: test runner, assertion libraries, mocking frameworks]
```

**Required subsections:** Test Types, Coverage Expectations
**Optional subsections:** Test Tooling
**Required diagrams:** Test strategy flowchart
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05), Build Standards

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Test Types:** Unit tests validate individual modules in isolation. Integration tests verify module interactions against contract specifications. End-to-end tests exercise critical user journeys through the full system. **Coverage Expectations:** Unit tests target 80% line coverage on core modules; integration tests cover all cross-module interfaces; e2e tests cover the top five user journeys.

**Incorrect:**
> We have unit tests and some integration tests. Coverage is pretty good.
> *Why wrong: Vague, no specific test type definitions, no coverage targets, and no rationale for the testing strategy.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** mixed
- **Audience:** engineer
- **Do:** Define each test type with its purpose, scope, and tooling; set measurable coverage targets with specific thresholds; document test tooling configuration and rationale
- **Don't:** Use vague claims like "coverage is pretty good"; omit specific coverage thresholds; describe feature-specific test cases rather than repository-wide test strategy

*(To be written by the domain expert. This section defines the repository-wide testing strategy, test types, and testing tooling standards.)*

## Code Standards

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/engineering/06-code_standards.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 2 subsections
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** none

```markdown
## Code Standards

> [metadata block]

### Style Guide

[1 paragraph: language-specific style reference, key rules]

### Linting Configuration

[1 paragraph: linter tool, config file location, key rules]

### Naming Conventions

[Optional: naming patterns for files, modules, functions, variables]
```

**Required subsections:** Style Guide, Linting Configuration
**Optional subsections:** Naming Conventions
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Engineering Principles

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Style Guide:** All modules follow the language's canonical style guide. Functions are named with verb-noun convention. Files are named after the module they contain. **Linting Configuration:** The linter is configured to enforce the style guide. Config lives at the repository root. All CI builds must pass the linter before merge.

**Incorrect:**
> We use tabs for indentation and camelCase for variables. Our linter catches some errors.
> *Why wrong: Missing rationale, missing configuration location, no connection to engineering principles, and lacks completeness on scope.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** prescriptive
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** engineer
- **Do:** Reference the specific style guide by name and language; document linting configuration file location and key rules; explain non-obvious conventions that deviate from defaults
- **Don't:** Assume universal knowledge of conventions; omit configuration file locations; describe feature-specific patterns or implementation details

*(To be written by the domain expert. This section defines the repository-wide coding style, conventions, and code quality standards.)*

---

## Constraints

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/engineering/07-constraints.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** none

```markdown
## Constraints

> [metadata block]

[1–2 paragraphs explaining non-functional requirements and engineering
limitations, categorized by type (performance, security, compliance),
each with source attribution and verifiability]

### Performance Constraints

[Optional: latency, throughput, memory bounds]

### Security Constraints

[Optional: authentication, encryption, access control requirements]

### Compliance Constraints

[Optional: regulatory, organizational policy requirements]
```

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** Performance Constraints, Security Constraints, Compliance Constraints
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05), External Context

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Performance:** API responses must complete within 200ms at the 95th percentile (source: Architecture Section 4.3). **Security:** All data in transit must use TLS 1.2 or higher (source: External Context compliance requirements). **Compliance:** User data must be deletable on request within 30 days (source: regulatory requirements).

**Incorrect:**
> The application should be fast and secure. We follow industry best practices.
> *Why wrong: Not verifiable, no specific thresholds, no source attribution, and no categorization by type — making it impossible to audit.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** prescriptive
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** engineer
- **Do:** Categorize every constraint by type (performance, security, compliance); cite the source of each constraint (Architecture section, External Context); make every constraint verifiable with specific thresholds
- **Don't:** State vague requirements like "the application should be fast"; omit source attribution for constraints; list constraints without categorization or verification criteria

*(To be written by the domain expert. This section defines the non-functional requirements and engineering limitations that bound all implementation decisions.)*

## Required Sections

Every Engineering document must contain the following sections.
Sections are identified by heading text; the compiler maps each to a semantic type.

| Section | semantic_type | Required | Aliases | Content Requirements |
|---------|--------------|----------|---------|----------------------|
| Engineering Principles | `guiding_principles` | ✓ | Principles, Core Principles | Technology-independent values, stable across features, memorable phrasing |
| Technology Selection | `rationale` | ✓ | Technology Choices, Technology Rationale, Why | Rationale for each choice; not a bare list; connected to Architecture and External Context |
| Build Standards | `build_standards` | ✓ | Build, Build Process, CI/CD | Build system, pipeline stages, quality gates, rationale for each stage |
| Testing Standards | `testing_standards` | ✓ | Testing, Test Strategy | Test types, coverage expectations, test tooling, rationale |
| Purpose | `purpose` | | Overview, Summary | Document's role in ecosystem, scope boundaries, relationship to adjacent standards |
| Code Standards | `code_standards` | | Coding Standards, Code Style | Style guide, linting configuration, naming conventions, rationale |
| Constraints | `constraints` | | Limitations, Non-Functional Requirements | Non-functional requirements categorized by type, verifiable, connected to source |
| Traceability | `traceability` | | Traces To, Derived From | Derivation diagram, upstream/downstream list, non-contradiction rule |

Section headings are case-insensitive. Sections not listed here are stored as `generic` type — preserved but not queryable by type.

## Goals

Engineering Documentation aims to:

* Give the codebase one authoritative source for technology rationale and repo-wide standards.
* Make build, test, and code-quality expectations explicit.
* Keep engineering decisions traceable to Architecture and Security rather than arbitrary.

---

## Non-Goals

Engineering Documentation does not define:

* Product Vision
* Feature Specifications
* Feature Design
* Feature Technical Design
* Shared Architecture
* Source Code
* Algorithms
* API Implementations
* Business Logic

These responsibilities belong to other documentation standards.

---

## Success Criteria

Engineering Documentation is successful when:

* Engineers understand why the repository is engineered as it is.
* Technology choices are justified.
* Repository-wide engineering practices are consistent.
* New contributors can understand engineering decisions without reading source code.
* AI systems can implement features while respecting repository engineering conventions.
* Engineering decisions remain stable, traceable, and maintainable throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## Responsibilities

Engineering Documentation is responsible for defining:

* Engineering principles
* Implementation standards
* Technology selection rationale
* Dependency standard
* Repository organization
* Development conventions
* Build standard
* Testing standard
* Deployment standard
* Packaging standard
* Persistence standard
* Configuration standard
* Security standard
* Performance standard
* Observability standard
* Versioning standard
* Release standard
* Migration standard
* Engineering constraints

Engineering Documentation establishes reusable engineering decisions for the repository.

---

## Scope

Engineering Documentation may include:

* Engineering Principles
* Implementation Standards
* Technology Selection
* Dependency Standards
* Repository Structure
* Build Standards
* Packaging Standards
* Testing Standards
* Deployment Standards
* Persistence Standards
* Configuration Standards
* Security Standards
* Performance Standards
* Logging Standards
* Monitoring Standards
* Localization Standards
* Plugin Standards
* Release Standards
* Migration Standards
* Operational Guidelines

Projects should document only the engineering domains relevant to the repository.

Engineering Documentation is intentionally modular.

---

## Out of Scope

Engineering Documentation must not describe:

* Product Vision
* Product Features
* Feature Design
* Feature Technical Design
* Shared Architecture
* Individual feature implementations
* Source code
* Algorithms
* Class implementations
* Function implementations
* Business requirements

Engineering explains implementation standard.

It does not contain implementation itself.

---

## Inputs

Engineering Documentation derives from:

* Architecture Documentation
* Feature Technical Design
* Relevant External Context
* Security Requirements
* Engineering Principles
* Organizational Standards

Engineering Documentation should not derive from implementation.

---

## Outputs

Engineering Documentation provides direction for:

* Source Code Implementation
* Repository Organization
* Build Pipelines
* Testing
* Deployment
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Delivery
* Operational Procedures

Implementation should conform to the documented engineering standards.

---

## Traceability

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/engineering/08-traceability.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** flowchart

```markdown
## Traceability

> [metadata block]

[1 paragraph stating the non-contradiction constraint and traceability principle]

> **diagram:** flowchart showing derivation chain

### Upstream Sources

[List of upstream documents that feed into Engineering]

### Downstream Consumers

[List of downstream documents that derive from Engineering]
```

**Required subsections:** Upstream Sources, Downstream Consumers
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** Derivation chain flowchart
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05), Feature Technical Design(10), Implementation

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Upstream Sources:** Architecture(05) provides system-wide design decisions. External Context provides compliance and platform constraints. **Downstream Consumers:** Implementation derives build, test, and code conventions from this document. Feature Technical Design references engineering standards for technology conformance. **Non-contradiction rule:** No downstream document may contradict a standard established here.

**Incorrect:**
> This document traces to Architecture.
> *Why wrong: Missing downstream consumers, no non-contradiction rule, no derivation diagram, and incomplete traceability chain.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** structural
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** mixed
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Include a derivation diagram showing the full chain; list every upstream source and downstream consumer explicitly; state the non-contradiction rule as an enforceable constraint
- **Don't:** Leave derivation paths implicit or assume they are obvious; omit downstream consumers; use traceability as a summary rather than a verifiable chain

Engineering Documentation remains traceable.

## Relationships

| Document                 | Relationship                                             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Architecture             | Applies architectural decisions to engineering practices |
| Feature Technical Design | Provides feature-specific engineering context            |
| Security                 | Applies security requirements to engineering practices   |
| External Context         | Applies external engineering constraints                 |
| Implementation           | Realizes engineering standards                          |

---

## Required Characteristics

Engineering Documentation should be:

* Rationale-driven, not just prescriptive
* Consistent across the repository
* Reviewable independent of any single feature
* Traceable to Architecture and Security
* Stable
* Convention-respecting

---

## Audit Rules

An audit should verify:

* Repository-wide engineering principles are documented.
* Technology selection includes rationale.
* Engineering standards align with Architecture.
* Relevant External Context has been applied.
* Documents remain modular.
* Responsibilities do not overlap.
* Feature-specific engineering is absent.
* Source code is not documented.
* Engineering rationale is explicit rather than implied.

Engineering quality is evaluated across the complete Engineering Documentation collection.

---

## Validation Rules

Engineering Documentation is considered valid when:

* Engineering principles are documented.
* Repository-wide standards are clearly defined.
* Technology choices include engineering rationale.
* External engineering constraints are identified.
* Documents remain modular.
* Feature-specific implementation details are absent.
* Source code is not documented.
* Engineering standards remain traceable to Architecture.

Validation applies to the Engineering Documentation collection.

---

## Generation Rules

When generating Engineering Documentation:

* Focus on repository-wide engineering decisions.
* Explain why engineering decisions exist.
* Organize documentation by engineering concern.
* Apply Architecture consistently.
* Apply relevant External Context.
* Reference rather than duplicate shared documentation.
* Avoid implementation details.
* Preserve engineering consistency.

---

## Enhancement Rules

When enhancing Engineering Documentation:

* Improve engineering rationale.
* Strengthen repository-wide consistency.
* Remove duplicated architectural information.
* Remove duplicated External Context.
* Improve traceability.
* Improve modularity.
* Preserve engineering intent.

Engineering Documentation should become easier to understand and maintain without changing implementation behavior.

---

## Summary

Engineering Documentation is the repository-wide engineering specification.

It is a modular collection of documents that explains the engineering principles, implementation standards, technology selection rationale, development conventions, and operational practices required to realize the documented architecture.

Its purpose is to provide a reusable engineering foundation that guides implementation consistently across the repository while remaining independent of feature-specific implementations and source code.

---

## Common Mistakes

Examples include:

* Documenting feature implementations.
* Rewriting Architecture Documentation.
* Embedding source code.
* Explaining algorithms.
* Duplicating External Context.
* Mixing repository-wide standard with feature-specific engineering.
* Describing implementation instead of engineering rationale.

These should be reported during audits.

---

## Documentation Folder

Engineering documents live under:

```text
docs/raw/engineering/
```

---

## Implementation Folder

Engineering Documentation must declare the repository's implementation folder.

One engineering document must include a section titled **Repository Structure** that:

* names the top-level folder containing all implementation source code
* explains the rationale for that folder name and layout
* describes the high-level module or crate organization within it

This declaration is the authoritative source for the `implementation-audit`. The audit reads this section to locate source code before auditing. If the declaration is absent, the implementation audit cannot proceed.

Example structure for the declaration:

```
## Repository Structure

Implementation lives under `<folder>/`.

Rationale: <reason for folder name and layout>.

Top-level modules:
- `<folder>/module-a/` — <responsibility>
- `<folder>/module-b/` — <responsibility>
```

The implementation folder name and rationale must be kept current whenever the source layout changes.

---

## Usage

Written and maintained by senior engineers/tech leads as repository-wide decisions are made; read by every contributor before touching build, test, or deployment tooling. Use `samgraha audit --domain engineering` to confirm Technology Selection includes rationale (not just a list of choices) and that the Repository Structure declaration required by the `implementation-audit` is present and current.

## Related

- [Architecture Standard](05-architecture-standards.md) — engineering practices apply architectural decisions
- [Feature Technical Standard](10-feature-technical-standards.md) — feature-specific engineering context
- [Standards Reference Standard](standards.md) — how this standard itself is documented

## Engineering as a Documentation Collection

Engineering Documentation is a collection of focused engineering documents.

Example:

```text
engineering/

    engineering-principles.md

    implementation-standards.md

    technology-selection.md

    dependency-standards.md

    repository-structure.md

    build-standards.md

    testing-standards.md

    deployment-standards.md

    persistence-standards.md

    security-standards.md

    performance-standards.md

    localization-standards.md

    packaging-standards.md
```

Each document should describe one engineering concern.

Responsibilities should not overlap.

---

## Single Responsibility

Every Engineering document should describe one reusable engineering concern.

Examples include:

* Build Standards
* Dependency Standards
* Repository Structure
* Testing Standards
* Deployment Standards
* Persistence Standards
* Security Standards

Large documents should be decomposed into smaller focused documents.

---

## Engineering Principles

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/engineering/01-guiding_principles.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph
> **length_guidance:** concise
> **diagram_requirements:** none

```markdown
## Engineering Principles

> [metadata block]

[1 paragraph explaining how principles guide engineering decisions]

[bulleted list of principles, each as a memorable phrase with 1–sentence explanation]
```

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05), Vision(01)

### Examples

**Correct:**
> * **Minimal Dependencies:** We prefer fewer external dependencies to reduce maintenance burden and security surface. When a choice exists between a library and a self-contained implementation, the trade-off is evaluated against long-term maintenance cost.
> * **Explicit Configuration:** All configuration must be declared in version-controlled files. Environment-specific overrides use a documented override mechanism, not undocumented runtime state.

**Incorrect:**
> * Use the fastest framework available.
> * Always use the latest version of every library.
> * Write clean code.
> * *Why wrong: Technology-dependent ("fastest framework"), unstable ("latest version"), and vague ("clean code") — none of these survive technology changes or guide engineering decisions when ambiguity arises.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** prescriptive
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** engineer
- **Do:** Phrase each principle as a memorable, technology-independent value; ensure every principle is actionable when an engineering decision is ambiguous; keep the total number of principles manageable
- **Don't:** Use technology-specific language or framework references; state vague platitudes like "write clean code"; add principles that change with technology versions or feature scope

Engineering Documentation should establish reusable principles such as:

* Documentation First
* Architecture First
* Convention over Configuration
* Explicit Configuration
* Minimal Dependencies
* Repository Isolation
* Local First
* Offline First
* Deterministic Builds
* Separation of Concerns
* Progressive Enhancement
* Secure by Default
* Fail Fast
* Observable Systems

Projects may define additional engineering principles appropriate to their domain.

---

## Technology Selection

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/engineering/02-rationale.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 2 subsections
> **length_guidance:** extensive
> **diagram_requirements:** none

```markdown
## Technology Selection

> [metadata block]

### [Technology Category]

[1 paragraph explaining why this technology was chosen,
connected to architectural constraints and external context]

[repeat for each technology category: Language, Framework, Database, Tooling, etc.]
```

**Required subsections:** One per technology category (Language, Framework, Database, Tooling as applicable)
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05), External Context, Constraints

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Language:** Project Alpha uses Python 3.12+ because the team has deep expertise, the ecosystem provides mature libraries for data processing, and the architecture requires rapid prototyping cycles. This choice is constrained by the organization's existing Python infrastructure (External Context) and the need for readable, maintainable code (Architecture Section 2.1).

**Incorrect:**
> **Language:** Python. **Framework:** Django. **Database:** PostgreSQL.
> *Why wrong: This is a bare list with no rationale, no connection to Architecture or External Context, and no explanation of why these technologies were chosen.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** third person
- **Structure:** paragraphs
- **Audience:** engineer
- **Do:** Connect every technology choice to an architectural constraint or External Context source; explain why each technology was chosen, not just what was chosen; group rationale by engineering concern
- **Don't:** Present technology choices as bare lists without rationale; justify choices on business or trend grounds rather than engineering grounds; conflate selection rationale with implementation details

Technology selection should describe engineering rationale rather than implementation details.

Engineering Documentation should explain **why** technologies were selected.

Examples include:

* Why Rust
* Why Kotlin
* Why Electron
* Why React
* Why SQLite
* Why TOML
* Why MCP
* Why gRPC
* Why Local Storage

---

## External Context Application

Engineering Documentation should identify External Context that influences repository-wide engineering decisions.

Examples include:

* Internal frameworks
* Runtime platforms
* Build systems
* Packaging tools
* Platform capabilities
* Shared protocols
* Organizational engineering standards

External Context should be referenced rather than duplicated.

Only repository-wide engineering dependencies should be documented.

---

## Quality Requirements

Engineering Documentation should be:

* Modular
* Reusable
* Repository-wide
* Technology focused
* Rationale driven
* Maintainable
* Traceable
* Consistent

Engineering decisions should remain stable unless engineering standard changes.
