## Purpose

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/purpose.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 2 paragraphs
> **length_guidance:** concise
> **diagram_requirements:** none

[Definition paragraph: what Feature Technical Design is and its role in the documentation ecosystem]

[Scope paragraph: what it covers and what it does not, including one-to-one relationship with Feature and distinction from Architecture]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Feature(04), Architecture(05)

This document defines the standard for Feature Technical Design Documentation within the engineering documentation ecosystem.

Feature Technical Design translates a single Feature Specification into its architectural realization by applying the shared principles, boundaries, and constraints defined by the Architecture Documentation together with any relevant External Context.

Feature Technical Design is **not** shared Architecture.

It is the application of reusable architectural principles to one specific feature.

Every Feature Technical Design document has a strict one-to-one relationship with a Feature Specification.

Feature Technical Design explains **how the system architecture realizes a feature**.
It does not describe implementation details or source code.

### Examples

**Correct:**
> Feature Technical Design is the architectural realization of a single Feature Specification. It applies the shared principles defined by Architecture Documentation together with relevant External Context to one specific feature. Every Feature Technical Design document maintains a strict one-to-one relationship with its corresponding Feature Specification, explaining how the system architecture realizes that feature without describing implementation details.

**Incorrect:**
> Feature Technical Design covers all features in the system, including User Authentication, Order Processing, Payment Handling, and Notification Delivery. It combines shared architecture with feature-specific requirements into a single comprehensive document.
> *Why wrong: This violates the one-to-one relationship principle — Feature Technical Design must correspond to exactly one Feature Specification, not combine multiple features into a single document.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** third person
- **Structure:** paragraphs
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Define Feature Technical Design in relation to the documentation ecosystem; explicitly state what it is not; maintain the one-to-one mapping constraint throughout
- **Don't:** Drift into implementation specifics; conflate with Architecture or Feature Design; list features or technologies

## Participating Components

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/participating_components.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + table or list
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** component

[Component list or table: each participating component with a brief statement of why it is involved]

[Optional paragraph: relationship to Architecture component model]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** component diagram showing participating components
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05) component model, Feature Specification

*(To be written. This section lists the components involved in realizing the feature.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> | Component | Reason for Participation |
> |---|---|
> | Authentication Component | Validates user credentials and manages session lifecycle for the login feature |
> | Data Component | Stores and retrieves user account data required for authentication |
> | Notification Component | Delivers security alerts (e.g., new device login) triggered by authentication events |
> | UI Component | Presents the login interface and communicates user input to the Authentication Component |

**Incorrect:**
> | Component | Technology |
> |---|---|
> | AuthService | Node.js microservice using Express framework |
> | UserDatabase | PostgreSQL 15 with TypeORM |
> | EmailSender | Nodemailer with SMTP transport |
> | LoginView | React 18 with TypeScript |
> *Why wrong: This lists implementation technologies (Node.js, PostgreSQL, React) rather than architectural components with their purpose for participation. Component names should come from the Architecture component model, not from implementation.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** tables
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Use component names from Architecture Documentation; state the reason each component participates in this specific feature; include a component diagram
- **Don't:** List technologies, frameworks, or library names; describe component internals; include components not directly involved in the feature

---

## Component Interactions

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/component_interactions.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + interaction list
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** sequence

[Interaction list: each interaction with triggering condition, nature of exchange, and expected outcome]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** sequence diagram showing component interactions
**Required cross-references:** Participating Components, Feature Specification, Architecture(05) communication model

*(To be written. This section describes how components interact to realize the feature.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Interaction: Order Submission**
> - Triggering condition: User submits an order through the UI Component
> - Nature of exchange: UI Component sends a synchronous request to the Order Component; Order Component validates and delegates payment to the Payment Component
> - Expected outcome: Order is created in Submitted state; payment is initiated; user receives confirmation or rejection
>
> **Interaction: Order Completion Notification**
> - Triggering condition: Order Component transitions order to Completed state
> - Nature of exchange: Order Component publishes an asynchronous event to the Event Bus; Notification Component consumes the event
> - Expected outcome: User receives a notification confirming order completion

**Incorrect:**
> **Interaction: Order Submission**
> - The React `OrderForm` component calls `POST /api/orders` using axios
> - Express router passes to `OrderController.submit()` which calls `OrderService.process()`
> - `OrderService` calls `PaymentClient.charge()` with a JWT token in the Authorization header
> *Why wrong: This describes implementation-level details (React components, axios, Express routes, specific class methods, JWT tokens) rather than architectural component interactions, triggering conditions, and expected outcomes.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** engineer
- **Do:** State the triggering condition, nature of exchange, and expected outcome for each interaction; trace every interaction to a Feature Specification behavior; include a sequence diagram
- **Don't:** Name specific classes, methods, or API endpoints; describe serialization formats or protocols; use implementation-level communication details

## Data Ownership

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/data_ownership.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + ownership table or list
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** ER

[Data ownership table or list: each data element with owner component, read access, write access, and constraints]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** ER diagram showing data ownership boundaries
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05) ownership rules, Participating Components

*(To be written. This section defines data ownership boundaries for the feature.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> | Data Element | Owner | Read Access | Write Access | Constraints |
> |---|---|---|---|---|
> | User Credentials | Authentication Component | Authentication Component only | Authentication Component only | Must not be exposed outside security boundary |
> | Order Records | Order Component | Order Component, Notification Component (read-only) | Order Component only | Order state transitions follow the lifecycle defined in Runtime Behavior |
> | User Preferences | Data Component | Notification Component, Order Component | Data Component only | Preferences affect notification routing |

**Incorrect:**
> | Data Element | Table | Column | Type |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | User Credentials | users | password_hash | VARCHAR(255) |
> | Order Records | orders | status | ENUM('pending','confirmed','failed') |
> | User Preferences | user_preferences | notification_enabled | BOOLEAN |
> *Why wrong: This describes database schema details (table names, column names, data types) rather than component ownership, read/write access boundaries, and architectural constraints.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** tables
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Assign one owning component per data element; define read and write access boundaries explicitly; reference Architecture ownership rules; include an ER diagram
- **Don't:** Describe database schemas, column types, or ORM mappings; allow multiple owners for the same data element; use implementation-specific storage details

---

## Feature Specification

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/feature_specification.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph
> **length_guidance:** concise
> **diagram_requirements:** none

[Feature reference: name of the Feature Specification and brief confirmation that scope matches]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Feature(04)

*(To be written. This section references the Feature Specification this design realizes.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> This Feature Technical Design realizes the **User Authentication** Feature Specification. The scope of this design covers credential validation, session management, and secure access — matching the Feature's defined scope. No additional features are addressed in this document.

**Incorrect:**
> This Feature Technical Design realizes the **User Authentication** Feature Specification, which requires: users must be able to log in with email and password, reset passwords via email link, enable two-factor authentication, and manage session devices. The login form must validate input in real time and show inline error messages.
> *Why wrong: This duplicates Feature Specification content (requirements, acceptance criteria, UI behavior) rather than referencing the Feature by name and confirming scope alignment.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** structural
- **Voice:** third person
- **Structure:** paragraphs
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Reference the Feature by exact name; confirm scope alignment between Feature and this design; state that no additional features are addressed
- **Don't:** Duplicate Feature requirements, acceptance criteria, or user stories; paraphrase Feature content; list multiple Feature Specifications

---

## Component Responsibilities

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/component_responsibilities.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + responsibility list
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** component

[Responsibility list: each participating component with its primary responsibility and alignment with Architecture]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** component diagram showing responsibility assignments
**Required cross-references:** Participating Components, Architecture(05) component model

*(To be written. This section defines what each component is responsible for.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Authentication Component:** Responsible for validating user credentials and issuing session tokens. Operates within the security boundary defined in Architecture.
>
> **Data Component:** Responsible for storing and retrieving user account information. Owns all account data per Architecture ownership rules. No other component may write account data directly.
>
> **Notification Component:** Responsible for delivering user-facing messages. Reads user preferences from the Data Component but does not own or modify account data.

**Incorrect:**
> **Authentication Component:** The `AuthService` class extends `BaseAuth` and implements the `login()` method using bcrypt.compare() for password verification and jsonwebtoken.sign() for token generation.
>
> **Data Component:** Uses TypeORM `@Repository` pattern with PostgreSQL. The `UserRepository` class provides `findById()`, `findByEmail()`, and `save()` methods.
> *Why wrong: This describes class hierarchies, specific method implementations, library usage, and ORM patterns rather than architectural responsibilities and ownership boundaries.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Assign a primary responsibility to every participating component; ensure responsibilities do not overlap; align each responsibility with Architecture ownership rules; include a component diagram
- **Don't:** Describe class hierarchies, method signatures, or library usage; assign shared ownership; leave any participating component without a defined responsibility

---

## Runtime Behavior

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/runtime_behavior.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + lifecycle description
> **length_guidance:** extensive
> **diagram_requirements:** flowchart

[Lifecycle description: initialization, execution flow, state transitions, and shutdown at the architectural level]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** flowchart showing runtime lifecycle and state transitions
**Required cross-references:** Component Interactions, Architecture(05) runtime boundaries

*(To be written. This section describes the runtime execution model for the feature.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Lifecycle: Order Processing**
> 1. **Initialization:** The Order Component starts and registers with the Event Bus. It subscribes to order submission events.
> 2. **Execution Flow:** When an order submission event arrives, the Order Component validates the request, delegates payment to the Payment Component, and updates order state.
> 3. **State Transitions:** An order moves through states: Submitted → Validated → PaymentPending → Confirmed → Completed (or Failed).
> 4. **Shutdown:** The Order Component unsubscribes from the Event Bus and completes any in-flight order processing before terminating.

**Incorrect:**
> **Lifecycle: Order Processing**
> 1. Initialize Spring Boot application context and connect to RabbitMQ using `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672`.
> 2. `OrderService.processOrder()` method validates input, calls `PaymentClient.charge()`, then `OrderRepository.save()`.
> 3. Use JPA entity states: `@Entity` Order with `@Enumerated` OrderStatus field.
> 4. `@PreDestroy` method closes RabbitMQ connection.
> *Why wrong: This describes Spring Boot initialization, AMQP connection strings, specific method names, JPA annotations, and `@PreDestroy` hooks rather than architectural runtime lifecycle, execution flow, and state transitions.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** mixed
- **Audience:** engineer
- **Do:** Describe the full lifecycle — initialization, execution flow, state transitions, and shutdown — at the architectural level; define each state and valid transitions; include a flowchart
- **Don't:** Name specific runtime frameworks, connection strings, or configuration files; describe threading or process models; use implementation-level lifecycle hooks

## Communication Paths

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/communication_paths.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + path list
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** sequence

[Communication path list: each path with direction, nature, and architectural protocol]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** sequence diagram showing communication paths
**Required cross-references:** Component Interactions, Architecture(05) communication model

*(To be written. This section defines communication paths between components.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Path: Order Component → Notification Component**
> - Direction: Outbound from Order to Notification
> - Nature: Asynchronous event publication — order completion triggers notification delivery
> - Architectural protocol: Event Bus (as defined in Architecture communication model)
>
> **Path: UI Component → Order Component**
> - Direction: Inbound request from UI to Order
> - Nature: Synchronous request — UI submits order and awaits confirmation
> - Architectural protocol: REST Gateway (as defined in Architecture communication model)

**Incorrect:**
> **Path: Order Component → Notification Component**
> - Direction: POST request to `https://notification-service/internal/events`
> - Nature: JSON payload with order ID and status fields
> - Protocol: HTTP/1.1 with Content-Type: application/json
> *Why wrong: This describes HTTP methods, URLs, payload formats, and protocol versions rather than the architectural communication path direction, nature, and protocol reference.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Define direction, nature, and architectural protocol for every communication path; trace each path to a Component Interaction; reference the Architecture communication model
- **Don't:** Specify HTTP methods, URLs, or payload schemas; describe serialization or wire formats; use library-specific communication patterns

## Integration Points

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/integration_points.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + integration list
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** component

[Integration list: each integration point with systems involved, nature, and boundary type (internal, external, third-party)]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** component diagram showing integration boundaries
**Required cross-references:** Feature Specification, Architecture(05) boundaries

*(To be written. This section identifies where the feature integrates with external systems.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Integration Point: Payment Processing**
> - Systems involved: Order Component and external Payment Processor
> - Nature: Synchronous request-response for transaction authorization
> - Boundary type: External — crosses the system boundary to a third-party service
>
> **Integration Point: User Notifications**
> - Systems involved: Notification Component and internal Messaging Platform
> - Nature: Asynchronous event publication
> - Boundary type: Internal — communication between components within the system boundary

**Incorrect:**
> **Integration Point: Payment Processing**
> - Call `POST https://api.paymentprocessor.com/v2/charge` with API key in `Authorization: Bearer` header
> - Parse JSON response and extract `transaction_id` field
> - Retry on HTTP 503 with exponential backoff
> *Why wrong: This describes API endpoint URLs, HTTP headers, response parsing, and retry logic rather than the architectural integration boundary, systems involved, and nature of the integration.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Identify every integration point with systems involved, nature of integration, and boundary type; classify each as internal, external, or third-party; include a component diagram
- **Don't:** Describe API endpoints, authentication token formats, or request/response schemas; specify retry logic or error handling at the integration; name client libraries

## External Dependency Integration

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/external_dependencies.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + dependency list
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** component

[Dependency list: each external dependency with name, role in feature, nature of integration, and constraints imposed]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** component diagram showing external dependencies
**Required cross-references:** External Context(08), Integration Points

*(To be written. This section describes how external dependencies participate in the feature.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Dependency: Identity Provider** (reference: External Context identity services)
> - Role in feature: Authenticates user credentials during login flow; provides identity verification for protected operations
> - Nature of integration: The Authentication Component delegates credential verification to the Identity Provider
> - Constraints: The Identity Provider requires network connectivity; authentication is unavailable if the provider is unreachable (see Failure Handling)

**Incorrect:**
> **Dependency: Identity Provider**
> - Use Auth0 SDK v4.2.1 to call the `/oauth/token` endpoint
> - Store refresh tokens in memory using the `auth0-spa-js` library
> - Handle 401 responses by redirecting to `/login`
> *Why wrong: This describes SDK versions, API endpoints, library usage, and HTTP status codes rather than the architectural role of the external dependency and constraints it imposes.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Reference External Context documents by name; state the role of each dependency in the feature; describe constraints imposed without duplicating External Context content; include a component diagram
- **Don't:** Duplicate External Context content; describe SDK versions or library APIs; specify implementation-level integration patterns

---

## Runtime Constraints

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/runtime_constraints.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + constraint list
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** none

[Constraint list: each operational constraint with source (Architecture or External Context) and application to this feature]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05) runtime boundaries, External Context(08)

*(To be written. This section defines operational constraints on runtime behavior.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Constraint: Concurrency Limit** (source: Architecture runtime boundaries)
> The Order Processing Component must handle concurrent order submissions without data corruption. The architectural model limits concurrent processing to the resource allocation defined for this component class.
>
> **Constraint: Resource Boundary** (source: External Context platform constraints)
> The feature must operate within the memory and compute boundaries defined by the hosting platform. Component lifecycle must respect the platform's resource management model.

**Incorrect:**
> **Constraint: Concurrency Limit**
> Use `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore` with permits=10 in the OrderService. Configure Tomcat max threads to 200 in server.xml. Set JVM heap to 4GB with `-Xmx4g`.
> *Why wrong: This specifies implementation-level concurrency tools (Java Semaphore), server configuration (Tomcat, server.xml), and JVM settings rather than architectural operational constraints.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** State each constraint as a clear operational limitation; cite the source from Architecture or External Context; explain how the constraint applies to this specific feature
- **Don't:** Specify implementation tools, frameworks, or configuration files; provide performance benchmarks or numerical thresholds; describe deployment or infrastructure details

---

## Architectural Constraints

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/architectural_constraints.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + constraint list
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** none

[Constraint list: each architectural constraint with Architecture source principle and application to this feature]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05) principles and constraints

*(To be written. This section defines architectural constraints the feature must respect.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Constraint: Component Ownership** (source: Architecture ownership rules)
> Each data element must have exactly one owning component. The Authentication Component owns credential data; no other component may write to it directly.
>
> **Constraint: Communication Model** (source: Architecture communication model)
> All inter-component communication must use the event bus defined in Architecture. Direct component-to-component calls are not permitted.

**Incorrect:**
> **Constraint: Component Ownership**
> Use a single PostgreSQL database for all component data. Each component writes to its own schema within the shared database using TypeORM repositories.
> *Why wrong: This specifies technology choices (PostgreSQL, TypeORM) and implementation patterns (shared database, schema separation) rather than architectural ownership principles and communication model constraints.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Reference each architectural constraint by its Architecture source principle; state how the constraint applies to this feature; avoid redefining architectural principles
- **Don't:** Redefine or paraphrase Architecture principles; introduce implementation-level constraints; name technologies or frameworks as constraints

## Security Considerations

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/security_considerations.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + security list
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** none

[Security list: security boundaries, authentication requirements, authorization rules, and sensitive data identification]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05) security boundaries, External Context(08), Security Documentation(03)

*(To be written. This section defines security considerations for the feature.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Security Boundary:** The Authentication Component operates within the security boundary defined by Architecture. Only authenticated requests may access the Data Component.
> **Authentication:** Requests from external systems must be validated against the identity provider defined in External Context(08).
> **Authorization:** The Notification Component may read user preferences but may not modify account data. Account data modification is restricted to the Account Component.
> **Sensitive Data:** User credentials and session tokens are classified as sensitive; they must not appear in communication paths that cross the external boundary.

**Incorrect:**
> **Security Boundary:** Use bcrypt for password hashing with 12 salt rounds. Implement JWT tokens using the jsonwebtoken npm library with RS256 algorithm. Store tokens in httpOnly cookies with SameSite=Strict.
> *Why wrong: This specifies implementation-level security details (specific algorithms, libraries, cookie configurations) rather than architectural security boundaries, authentication requirements, and authorization rules.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Define security boundaries, authentication requirements, and authorization rules at the architectural level; identify sensitive data; reference Architecture security boundaries and External Context security constraints
- **Don't:** Name specific encryption algorithms, libraries, or token formats; describe code-level security patterns; specify cookie or header configurations

## Performance Considerations

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/performance_considerations.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + performance list
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** none

[Performance list: performance expectations, throughput requirements, latency constraints, and resource limitations at the architectural level]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Feature Specification, Architecture(05) performance patterns

*(To be written. This section defines performance considerations for the feature.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Performance Expectation: Search Response**
> - Throughput: The search component must support concurrent queries from multiple client components without degrading response times
> - Latency constraint: Search results must be available to the UI component within the time expected for interactive use
> - Resource limitation: Search indexing must not consume more than the resource allocation defined in Architecture runtime boundaries

**Incorrect:**
> **Performance Expectation: Search Response**
> - Elasticsearch query must complete in under 200ms
> - Node.js event loop must not be blocked for more than 50ms
> - Use Redis caching with TTL of 300 seconds
> *Why wrong: This specifies technology-specific benchmarks (Elasticsearch, Node.js, Redis), exact latency numbers, and implementation details (caching TTL) rather than architectural performance expectations.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** State performance expectations as architectural constraints traceable to Feature Specification; define throughput, latency, and resource expectations at the system level; reference Architecture performance patterns
- **Don't:** Provide specific latency numbers or benchmarks; name profiling tools or caching libraries; describe optimization techniques or implementation strategies

---

## Failure Handling

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/failure_handling.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + failure list
> **length_guidance:** extensive
> **diagram_requirements:** flowchart

[Failure list: failure modes per interaction, error propagation paths, recovery strategies, and resilience boundaries]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** flowchart showing error propagation and recovery paths
**Required cross-references:** Component Interactions, Architecture(05) error boundaries, Component Responsibilities

*(To be written. This section defines how failures and errors are handled.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Failure Mode: External Service Unavailable**
> - Interaction affected: Order Service queries Payment Gateway
> - Propagation: Failure propagates from Payment Gateway to Order Service to Notification Service
> - Recovery: Order Service queues the order for retry; Notification Service informs the user that processing is delayed
> - Resilience boundary: Failure does not propagate beyond Order Service to the User Interface layer

**Incorrect:**
> **Failure Mode: External Service Unavailable**
> - Catch `PaymentTimeoutException` in `OrderService.java` line 142
> - Retry 3 times with exponential backoff using Spring Retry `@Retryable`
> - Log error with `LOGGER.error("Payment failed", e)`
> *Why wrong: This describes implementation-level error handling (specific exception types, code lines, framework annotations, logging calls) rather than architectural failure modes and recovery strategies.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** mixed
- **Audience:** engineer
- **Do:** Define failure modes for every component interaction; trace error propagation paths across architectural boundaries; state recovery strategies and resilience boundaries; include a flowchart
- **Don't:** Name specific exception types, error codes, or try/catch patterns; describe retry implementations or logging frameworks; reference code locations

## Extension Points

> *Structural rules: `audit/deterministic/section/feature-technical/extension_points.yaml`*

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + extension list
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** component

[Extension list: each extension point with type (plugin, hook, event, configuration) and constraints on extensions]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** component diagram showing extension points
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05) plugin architecture, Component Responsibilities

*(To be written. This section identifies where the feature can be extended.)*

### Examples

**Correct:**
> **Extension Point: Notification Dispatch**
> - Type: Event hook
> - Constraint: Extensions must implement the notification dispatch contract defined in Architecture plugin model; extensions cannot modify core notification routing

**Incorrect:**
> **Extension Point: Notification Dispatch**
> - Type: Custom JavaScript class extending BaseNotifier
> - Constraint: Must override onSend() method using the EventEmitter library API
> *Why wrong: This specifies implementation-level details (JavaScript class, method names, library APIs) rather than architectural extension type and constraints.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Identify extension points with type (plugin, hook, event, configuration) and constraints; reference the Architecture plugin model; ensure extension points are architecturally sound
- **Don't:** Name specific programming languages, class hierarchies, or library APIs; describe callback implementations; define extension mechanisms not present in Architecture

## Required Sections

Every Feature Technical Design document must contain the following sections.
Sections are identified by heading text; the compiler maps each to a semantic type.

| Section | semantic_type | Required | Aliases | Content Requirements |
|---------|--------------|----------|---------|----------------------|

## Goals

Feature Technical Design aims to:

* Give every feature a single authoritative technical realization plan.
* Keep it constrained by Architecture rather than reinventing structure per feature.
* Make the plan specific enough for Prototype to validate and Implementation to follow.

---

## Non-Goals

Feature Technical Design does not define:

* Product Vision
* Feature Requirements
* User Experience Design
* Shared Architecture
* Engineering rationale
* Technology selection decisions
* Source Code
* Algorithms
* API implementations

These responsibilities belong to other documentation standards.

---

## Success Criteria

Feature Technical Design is successful when:

* Every Feature has one corresponding Feature Technical Design.
* Shared architectural principles are consistently applied.
* Relevant External Context has been incorporated where necessary.
* User experience requirements are realized without redefining them.
* Engineers understand how the feature integrates into the system.
* Implementation can proceed without redefining architectural responsibilities.
* AI systems can implement the feature while preserving architecture, external constraints, and design intent.

---

## Responsibilities

Feature Technical Design is responsible for defining:

* Architectural realization of the feature
* Participating components
* Component responsibilities
* Component interactions
* Runtime behavior
* Communication paths
* Data ownership
* Integration points
* External dependency integration
* Runtime constraints
* Architectural constraints
* Security considerations
* Performance considerations
* Failure handling
* Extension points

Feature Technical Design bridges feature requirements and implementation through architecture.

---

## Scope

Feature Technical Design may describe:

* Component interactions
* Request flows
* Event flows
* Data flow
* State ownership
* Runtime lifecycle
* Persistence responsibilities
* Service boundaries
* IPC communication
* API interactions
* External integrations
* Plugin interactions
* Security boundaries
* Error propagation
* Performance considerations
* Cross-repository interactions

Every Feature Technical Design document should remain focused on one feature.

---

## Out of Scope

Feature Technical Design must not describe:

* Product Vision
* Feature Requirements
* User Experience
* Design Principles
* Shared Architecture
* Engineering rationale
* Programming languages
* Framework implementations
* Algorithms
* Source code
* Function implementations
* Build configuration
* Library APIs

Shared Architecture belongs to Architecture Documentation.

Technology rationale belongs to Engineering Documentation.

Implementation belongs to source code.

---

## Inputs

Feature Technical Design derives from:

* Feature Specification
* Architecture Documentation
* Relevant External Context (optional)
* Engineering Constraints

Feature Design is not a required input. It is considered only where user experience decisions directly influence architectural realization — see Feature Design Considerations.

Feature Technical Design should not derive from source code.

---

## Outputs

Feature Technical Design provides direction for:

* Engineering Documentation
* Source Code Implementation
* Unit Testing
* Integration Testing
* Performance Testing
* Security Validation

Implementation should conform to the documented technical design.

---

## Traceability

### Template

> **minimum_content:** 1 paragraph + derivation diagram
> **length_guidance:** moderate
> **diagram_requirements:** flowchart

[Derivation chain: Vision → Feature → Feature Technical Design → Engineering → Implementation]

[One-to-one mapping statement and input references to Architecture and External Context]

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** flowchart showing derivation chain
**Required cross-references:** Vision(01), Feature(04), Architecture(05), Engineering(07), External Context(08)

Feature Technical Design remains traceable.

                                  Implementation
```

Feature Specification and Architecture Documentation are required inputs. Feature Design is an optional input considered only where UX decisions influence architectural realization.

Every Feature Technical Design should trace directly to exactly one Feature Specification.

### Examples

**Correct:**
> Vision(01) → Feature: Authentication → Feature Technical Design: Authentication → Engineering: Authentication → Implementation: Authentication
>
> This Feature Technical Design traces to exactly one Feature Specification (Authentication). Architecture(05) security boundaries and External Context(08) identity provider constraints are applied as inputs.

**Incorrect:**
> Feature Technical Design: Authentication derives from the authentication API implementation in the source code.
> *Why wrong: Traceability must flow from Feature Specification and Architecture, not from source code. The derivation chain starts at Vision, not at implementation.*

### Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** structural
- **Voice:** third person
- **Structure:** mixed
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Show the full derivation chain from Vision through Feature to Implementation; assert one-to-one mapping with Feature Specification; reference Architecture and External Context as inputs; include a flowchart
- **Don't:** Trace to source code or implementation artifacts; omit upstream or downstream standards; leave the one-to-one mapping unstated

## Required Characteristics

Feature Technical Design should be:

* Architecturally consistent
* Traceable to exactly one Feature
* Specific enough to be technology-aware, unlike Feature Design
* Testable — Prototype can validate it, Implementation can follow it
* Boundary-respecting

---

## Audit Rules

An audit should verify:

* A one-to-one mapping exists between Feature and Feature Technical Design.
* Shared Architecture Documentation has been applied.
* Relevant External Context has been identified.
* Feature Design considerations have been respected.
* Component responsibilities are clearly defined.
* Communication paths are understandable.
* Runtime boundaries are respected.
* External architectural constraints are reflected.
* Technology references remain architectural.
* No implementation details appear.
* Architecture and External Context are referenced instead of duplicated.

Feature Technical Design quality is evaluated individually and across the feature collection.

---

## Validation Rules

Feature Technical Design is considered valid when:

* One document corresponds to one Feature.
* Shared Architecture Documentation has been applied.
* Relevant External Context has been identified.
* Component responsibilities are clearly defined.
* Runtime interactions are documented.
* External architectural constraints are respected.
* Feature Design considerations have been incorporated where appropriate.
* Technology references remain architectural rather than implementation specific.
* No source code appears.
* Technical Design remains traceable to the Feature Specification.

---

## Generation Rules

When generating Feature Technical Design:

* Start from the Feature Specification.
* Apply Architecture Documentation.
* Apply relevant External Context.
* Consider Feature Design where it influences architecture.
* Focus on responsibilities and interactions.
* Keep one document per feature.
* Reference shared Architecture.
* Reference External Context rather than duplicating it.
* Avoid implementation details.
* Preserve architectural consistency.

---

## Enhancement Rules

When enhancing Feature Technical Design:

* Improve architectural clarity.
* Improve component responsibility definitions.
* Strengthen consistency with Architecture Documentation.
* Strengthen consistency with External Context.
* Improve alignment with Feature Design.
* Remove duplicated architectural principles.
* Remove duplicated external documentation.
* Remove implementation leakage.
* Improve traceability.
* Preserve architectural intent.

Technical Design should become clearer without changing feature behavior.

---

## Summary

Feature Technical Design Documentation is the architectural realization of a single Feature Specification.

Each document maintains a strict one-to-one relationship with its corresponding Feature, applying the shared principles defined by the Architecture Documentation together with any relevant External Context and considering Feature Design where architectural decisions affect user experience.

Its purpose is to bridge feature requirements and implementation by defining responsibilities, interactions, boundaries, integrations, and architectural constraints while preserving consistency across the product ecosystem and avoiding implementation-specific details.

---

## Common Mistakes

Examples include:

* Combining multiple features.
* Rewriting Architecture Documentation.
* Rewriting External Context.
* Embedding source code.
* Describing algorithms.
* Introducing implementation patterns.
* Ignoring Feature Design.
* Ignoring external architectural constraints.
* Duplicating shared architectural principles.

These should be reported during audits.

---

## Documentation Folder

Feature Technical Design documents live under:

```text
docs/raw/feature-technical/
```

---

## Usage

Written by the engineer implementing a Feature, applying Architecture's shared principles to that one feature before code is written. Use `samgraha audit --domain feature-technical` to check that Participating Components, Component Interactions, and Data Ownership are all documented before implementation starts.

## Related

- [Feature Standard](04-feature-standards.md) — one-to-one mapping
- [Architecture Standard](05-architecture-standards.md) — shared principles this standard applies
- [Engineering Standard](07-engineering-standards.md) — technology rationale used to implement this design
- [Standards Reference Standard](standards.md) — how this standard itself is documented

## One-to-One Mapping

Every Feature Specification should have exactly one corresponding Feature Technical Design document.

Example:

```text
features/

    authentication.md

feature-technical/

    authentication.md
```

Both documents describe the same feature from different perspectives.

No Feature Technical Design should describe multiple unrelated features.

---

## Architecture Principle Application

Feature Technical Design applies the reusable principles defined by Architecture Documentation.

Examples include:

* Component Model
* Runtime Boundaries
* Communication Model
* Security Boundaries
* Persistence Architecture
* Plugin Architecture
* Deployment Constraints
* Ownership Rules

Feature Technical Design should reference these principles rather than redefining them.

---

## External Context Application

Feature Technical Design should identify the External Context required to realize the feature.

Examples include:

* Internal shared frameworks
* Shared runtime libraries
* Platform capabilities
* Operating system services
* External APIs
* Communication protocols
* Authentication providers
* AI platforms
* Storage platforms

Feature Technical Design should describe how these external dependencies participate in the architectural realization of the feature.

External Context should be referenced rather than duplicated.

Only context relevant to the feature should be included.

---

## Feature Design Considerations

Feature Technical Design should consider Feature Design whenever user experience influences architectural decisions.

Examples include:

* Navigation requiring routing architecture
* Accessibility requiring architectural support
* Localization requiring resource architecture
* Offline behavior requiring synchronization architecture
* Responsive behavior requiring layout architecture
* Long-running workflows requiring orchestration

Feature Technical Design should realize Feature Design without redefining user experience.

---

## Architectural Realization Principles

Every Feature Technical Design should:

* Respect architectural boundaries.
* Preserve component ownership.
* Minimize coupling.
* Maximize cohesion.
* Reuse existing architectural patterns.
* Avoid introducing new architecture unnecessarily.
* Clearly define responsibilities.
* Clearly define communication.
* Respect external architectural constraints.

---

## Technology Independence

Feature Technical Design should remain implementation independent.

It may reference technologies only when they are architecturally significant.

Examples:

Acceptable:

* Electron Main Process
* Plugin Runtime
* SQLite Persistence Layer
* Event Bus
* REST Gateway
* Message Queue

Not Acceptable:

* React Hooks
* Axios usage
* SQL queries
* TypeScript interfaces
* Rust traits
* Function implementations

Implementation belongs to source code.

---

## Quality Requirements

Feature Technical Design should be:

* Feature-specific
* Architecturally consistent
* Traceable
* Cohesive
* Modular
* Maintainable
* Implementation independent
* Consistent with Architecture
* Consistent with External Context

Each document should remain focused on one feature.
