# Stage 2 — Audit

**Use case:** `repo_existing/case_1_no_documentation`
**Tier:** 3
**Domains:** feature-design, feature-technical

## Input

Documents produced by stage 1 (`01-generation.md`).

## Procedure

Run the real audit files unmodified. Produce a report per domain.

### Per-Domain Audit Files

| Domain | Deterministic doc | Semantic doc |
|---|---|---|
| feature-design | `audit/deterministic/document/09-feature-design.yaml` | `audit/semantic/document/09-feature-design.md` |
| feature-technical | `audit/deterministic/document/10-feature-technical.yaml` | `audit/semantic/document/10-feature-technical.md` |

Plus section-level audits for each. Score via `calculation/summary/final_score.yaml` — 4 equal buckets.

## Output

A report per domain. This stage never fixes anything.

## Differs From Other Use Cases

No difference — same audit files, same procedure.
