## Cross-Section Coherence Constraint

> Sourced from `audit/semantic/document/05-architecture.md` Engineering Intent.

Component Model, Data Flow, and Communication Paths must describe the same system without contradicting each other. Specifically:

- Every data ownership claim in Data Flow must trace to a component defined in Component Model
- Every communication path in Communication must connect components that Component Model defines as adjacent/related
- Component names must be used identically everywhere they appear across all sections
- The collection as a whole must read as one architecture, not several independent descriptions

If any section would introduce a component, data path, or communication path not present in another section, reconcile before outputting.

## Sections

### 1. Purpose

**Template:**

```markdown
This document defines the standard for [Documentation Type] within the [ecosystem name] documentation ecosystem.

[Documentation Type] describes [what it describes].

Unlike [related type], [distinctive characteristic].

[Core purpose statement.]
```

**Correct example:**
> This document defines the standard for Architecture Documentation within the engineering documentation ecosystem. Architecture Documentation describes the structural organization of a system — how responsibilities are divided among components and how those components relate. Unlike a single Vision or Feature document, Architecture is a collection of focused documents, each covering one structural concern.

**Incorrect example:**
> Architecture Documentation covers the microservices layout, the React component tree, the PostgreSQL schema, and the Kubernetes deployment manifests used by the system.
> *Why wrong: names specific technologies and implementation artifacts instead of stating the document type's role and boundary.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** structural
- **Voice:** third person
- **Structure:** paragraphs
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** State what Architecture Documentation is and what it is not in the same breath; describe it as a collection rather than a single artifact; keep the boundary with Engineering and Feature Technical Design explicit
- **Don't:** Name specific components, technologies, or frameworks; describe how any particular system is organized; list features or capabilities

---

### 2. System Overview

**Template:**

```markdown
## System Overview

### Overview
[1-2 paragraphs: system purpose, primary capabilities, high-level approach]

### Structural Approach
[1 paragraph: how the system is organized at the top level]

### Diagram
[High-level component or system context diagram]
```

**Correct example:**
> DataSync is a distributed data synchronization platform that coordinates data exchange between enterprise systems. It provides reliable, ordered delivery of data changes across heterogeneous datastores, supporting both real-time and batch synchronization modes. The system is organized into an ingestion layer, a transformation engine, and a distribution layer, each with distinct ownership and scaling characteristics.

**Incorrect example:**
> DataSync uses Apache Kafka 3.4 with Spring Boot 3.1 for event streaming, PostgreSQL 15 for metadata storage, and Redis 7 for caching. The backend runs on AWS EKS with Kubernetes 1.27.
> *Why wrong: names specific library versions, frameworks, and cloud infrastructure — this is Engineering detail, not architectural overview.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** structural
- **Voice:** third person
- **Structure:** paragraphs
- **Audience:** new contributor
- **Do:** Open with the system's purpose in one sentence; describe capabilities before structure; use a diagram to anchor the overview
- **Don't:** Name specific libraries or frameworks; describe component internals; assume the reader knows the codebase

**Required subsections:** Overview, Diagram
**Optional subsections:** Structural Approach, Key Capabilities
**Required diagrams:** system context or component overview diagram
**Required cross-references:** Vision(01)

---

### 3. Component Model

**Template:**

```markdown
## Component Model

### Components

#### [Component Name]
- **Responsibility:** [what this component owns]
- **Ownership:** [data/processes owned]
- **Interfaces:** [how other components interact with it]

#### [Component Name]
- **Responsibility:** [what this component owns]
- **Ownership:** [data/processes owned]
- **Interfaces:** [how other components interact with it]

### Component Diagram
[Diagram showing all components and their relationships]
```

**Correct example:**
> **Ingestion Service**
> - **Responsibility:** Accepts data changes from external systems and validates their structure before passing them downstream.
> - **Ownership:** Raw incoming change events, ingestion queues.
> - **Interfaces:** Exposes a submission endpoint; publishes validated events to the Transform Engine.
>
> **Transform Engine**
> - **Responsibility:** Applies mapping rules to convert incoming data formats into the canonical system model.
> - **Ownership:** Mapping rules, transformation state, intermediate representations.
> - **Interfaces:** Consumes validated events from Ingestion; publishes canonical records to Distribution.

**Incorrect example:**
> The Ingestion Service is implemented as a Node.js 20 Express app with 4 REST endpoints (`/api/v1/ingest`, `/api/v1/batch`, `/api/v1/status`, `/api/v1/health`). It uses Bull queues backed by Redis and calls `validateSchema()` from the shared `@datasync/validation` package.
> *Why wrong: describes implementation details (runtime, endpoints, package names, function signatures) instead of responsibility and ownership boundaries.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** structural
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** architect
- - **Do:** State each component's single responsibility; define ownership boundaries explicitly; include a component relationship diagram
- **Don't:** Describe class hierarchies or function signatures; conflate responsibility with implementation; list components without defining boundaries

**Required subsections:** Components (with one entry per component), Component Diagram
**Optional subsections:** Component Relationships, Boundary Definitions
**Required diagrams:** component relationship diagram
**Required cross-references:** System Overview, Communication, Data Flow

---

### 4. Communication

**Template:**

```markdown
## Communication

### Communication Paths
[For each communication path: source, destination, pattern (sync/async/event), contract]

### Interaction Patterns
[Description of communication patterns used across the system]

### Communication Diagram
[Sequence or flow diagram showing inter-component communication]
```

**Correct example:**
> **Ingestion → Transform Engine**
> - **Pattern:** Asynchronous, event-driven.
> - **Contract:** Ingestion publishes a validated event; Transform Engine acknowledges receipt and processes independently. Events are idempotent and ordered within a single source.
>
> **Transform Engine → Distribution**
> - **Pattern:** Asynchronous, queue-based.
> - **Contract:** Transform publishes canonical records with a unique identifier. Distribution guarantees at-least-once delivery and deduplicates on the identifier.

**Incorrect example:**
> Ingestion calls Transform via HTTP POST to `http://transform:8080/process` with a JSON body. It uses Axios with a 5-second timeout and retries 3 times with exponential backoff. Responses are validated against the OpenAPI schema in `transform-api.yaml`.
> *Why wrong: specifies network protocols, library choices, timeout values, and implementation-level retry logic — all of which belong in Engineering, not Architecture.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** tables
- **Audience:** engineer
- **Do:** Define a contract for every component-to-component path; classify each interaction pattern (sync, async, event-driven); include a sequence diagram
- **Don't:** Specify network protocols or transport details; describe retry logic or timeout values; conflate communication paths with data paths

**Required subsections:** Communication Paths, Communication Diagram
**Optional subsections:** Interaction Patterns, Contract Definitions
**Required diagrams:** sequence diagram of primary communication paths
**Required cross-references:** Component Model, Data Flow

---

### 5. Data Flow

**Template:**

```markdown
## Data Flow

### Data Paths
[For each major data path: entry point, transformations, ownership boundaries, exit point]

### Data Ownership
[Table or list mapping data entities to owning components]

### Data Flow Diagram
[Flowchart showing data movement through the system]
```

**Correct example:**
> **Inbound Data Path**
> - **Entry point:** External system submits data changes.
> - **Transformations:** Schema validation and format normalization.
> - **Ownership boundary:** Ingestion Service owns raw events until transformation completes.
> - **Exit point:** Canonical records delivered to Distribution.
>
> **Data Ownership**
> | Data Entity | Owning Component |
> |---|---|
> | Raw incoming events | Ingestion Service |
> | Canonical records | Transform Engine |
> | Delivery confirmations | Distribution Service |

**Incorrect example:**
> Data flows through a PostgreSQL table called `raw_events` with columns `id`, `payload`, `created_at`. The Transform Engine runs a SQL query `SELECT * FROM raw_events WHERE processed = false`, deserializes the JSONB payload using `JSON.parse()`, and inserts into `canonical_records` via an ORM bulk insert.
> *Why wrong: describes database schemas, SQL queries, and code-level operations — these are implementation details, not architectural data flow.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** third person
- **Structure:** tables
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Trace every major data path from entry to exit; assign ownership to a specific component at each boundary; include a data flow diagram
- **Don't:** Describe database schemas or SQL queries; reference ORM methods or serialization code; document data paths that bypass component boundaries

**Required subsections:** Data Paths, Data Flow Diagram
**Optional subsections:** Data Ownership, Data Transformations
**Required diagrams:** data flow diagram covering all major paths
**Required cross-references:** Component Model, Communication, Security

---

### 6. Security

**Template:**

```markdown
## Security

### Trust Boundaries
[Description of where trust changes — external/internal, component-to-component]

### Threat Model
[Key threats, attack vectors, and mitigations at the architectural level]

### Security Controls
[Architectural security measures — access control model, data protection requirements]
```

**Correct example:**
> **Trust Boundaries**
> - **External → Ingestion:** Untrusted external systems submit data; Ingestion validates all inputs before internal processing.
> - **Ingestion → Transform:** Trusted boundary — both are internal components communicating over an internal network.
>
> **Threat Model**
> - **Spoofing:** External systems may impersonate legitimate data sources. Mitigation: authenticated submission with signed payloads.
> - **Data tampering:** Malicious payloads may attempt to exploit downstream processing. Mitigation: schema validation at the Ingestion boundary.

**Incorrect example:**
> We use JWT tokens signed with RS256 via the `jsonwebtoken` library. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds). The API gateway uses Kong 3.4 with rate limiting of 100 req/min. All traffic is encrypted with TLS 1.3.
> *Why wrong: specifies concrete libraries, library versions, configuration values, and protocol versions — these are Engineering implementation details, not architectural security controls.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** mixed
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Define every trust boundary with source and destination; document the threat model before controls; tie each control to a specific threat
- **Don't:** Name specific security libraries or libraries' configuration values; describe implementation of encryption or authentication; omit a threat that has no documented mitigation

**Required subsections:** Trust Boundaries, Threat Model
**Optional subsections:** Security Controls, Access Control Model
**Required diagrams:** trust boundary diagram
**Required cross-references:** Component Model, Data Flow, Philosophy(02)

---

### 7. Rationale

**Template:**

```markdown
## Rationale

### [Decision Name]
- **Context:** [what prompted this decision]
- **Decision:** [what was decided]
- **Alternatives Considered:** [what else was evaluated]
- **Rejection Reason:** [why alternatives were rejected]
- **Architectural Goal:** [which goal this serves]
```

**Correct example:**
> **Event-Driven Ingestion**
> - **Context:** Multiple external systems submit data at unpredictable rates and volumes.
> - **Decision:** Ingestion publishes events asynchronously rather than processing synchronously.
> - **Alternatives Considered:** Synchronous request/response ingestion with backpressure.
> - **Rejection Reason:** Synchronous processing would couple external system availability to ingestion availability, violating the reliability pillar.
> - **Architectural Goal:** Resilient Connections.

**Incorrect example:**
> We chose Kafka over RabbitMQ because it has better throughput benchmarks and our team already knows the Java client library.
> *Why wrong: justifies a specific technology choice by implementation-level benchmarks and team familiarity — that belongs in Engineering's rationale, not Architecture's.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** third person
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Record the context that prompted each decision; name the alternatives that were actually considered; tie every decision back to an architectural goal or pillar
- **Don't:** Justify decisions by technology benchmarks, licensing, or team familiarity; record decisions without a rejected alternative; let rationale entries go stale once a decision is superseded

---

### 8. Constraints

**Template:**

```markdown
## Constraints

### Hard Constraints
[Constraints that cannot be violated — with source and reason for each]

### Soft Constraints
[Preferences and guidelines that should be followed unless justified]

### Platform Constraints
[Hardware, OS, or runtime constraints that shape architecture]
```

**Correct example:**
> **Hard Constraints**
> - **Offline-first operation** (source: Platform Pillars) — the system must remain functional with no network connection; no component may assume live connectivity.
> - **Single-writer data ownership** (source: External Context) — the upstream partner system requires exactly one writer per record to avoid conflict resolution on their side.
>
> **Soft Constraints**
> - Prefer components that can be tested in isolation, unless a hard constraint makes isolation impractical.

**Incorrect example:**
> The system must use Rust 1.75+ and target a minimum of 4GB RAM.
> *Why wrong: states a language version and hardware minimum as if they were architectural constraints, without a source or architectural reason.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** prescriptive
- **Voice:** third person
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Attribute every constraint to its source (External Context, Platform Pillars, organizational rule); separate hard constraints from soft preferences explicitly; state the consequence of violating a hard constraint
- **Don't:** List a constraint without a source; mix implementation-level limits (language versions, dependency pins) into architectural constraints; present preferences as if they were immovable

**Required subsections:** Hard Constraints
**Optional subsections:** Soft Constraints, Platform Constraints
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** External Context, Platform Pillars(01)

### 9. Traceability

**Template:**

```markdown
## Traceability

### Derivation Chain
[Diagram showing Architecture's position in the documentation tier model]

### Downstream Impact
[List of standards that Architecture constrains or feeds into]

### Non-Contradiction Rule
[Statement that no downstream document may contradict Architecture]
```

**Correct example:**
> Tier 2: Architecture (System Overview, Component Model, Security)
>     ├──→ Tier 3: Feature Technical Design
>     └──→ Tier 5: Engineering (soft, non-mandatory)
>
> **Non-contradiction rule:** No downstream document may describe a component boundary, ownership assignment, or communication path that contradicts this Architecture. When a Feature Technical Design needs a boundary Architecture doesn't define, Architecture is updated first.

**Incorrect example:**
> Architecture traces to the `src/components/` directory and the deployment YAML files.
> *Why wrong: references source code and deployment configuration instead of the documentation hierarchy.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** diagrams
- **Audience:** architect
- **Do:** Show Architecture's tier position and every standard it feeds; state the non-contradiction rule explicitly; keep the diagram in sync when new standards derive from Architecture
- **Don't:** Reference source code, deployment artifacts, or CI/CD configuration; omit downstream standards from the diagram; leave the non-contradiction rule implicit

**Required subsections:** Derivation Chain, Non-Contradiction Rule
**Optional subsections:** Downstream Impact
**Required diagrams:** tier model diagram
**Required cross-references:** Vision(01), Feature Technical Design(10), Engineering(07)

### 10. Operational Readiness

**Template:**

```markdown
## Operational Readiness

### Deployment Automation
[CI/CD pipeline stages, gating criteria for production promotion]

### Rollback Procedure
[Automated vs. manual rollback, time target, tested status]

### Runbooks
[Top N known failure modes with linked runbooks and on-call routing]

### Scaling
[Horizontal and vertical scaling triggers with thresholds]

### Disaster Recovery
[RTO and RPO targets, derived from business requirements]

### Change Management
[Approval process, freeze windows, production promotion gates]
```

**Correct example:**
> **Deployment Automation**
> - Pipeline: Build → Integration Tests → Staging → Production
> - Gating: All integration tests pass; staging smoke test passes; one human approval for production
>
> **Rollback Procedure**
> - Automated rollback to previous version on health check failure
> - Rollback time target: < 5 minutes
> - Tested: Yes, weekly during game day exercises
>
> **Runbooks**
> - **Data ingestion stall:** Check ingestion queue depth; if > 10k for 5 min, restart ingestion service. [Runbook: ingestion-stall.md]
>
> **Disaster Recovery**
> - RPO: 1 hour (snapshot-based backup)
> - RTO: 4 hours (full re-deployment from last snapshot)

**Incorrect example:**
> We deploy using Kubernetes. Rollback is handled on a case-by-case basis by the on-call engineer. Scaling is manual.
> *Why wrong: lacks specific procedures, time targets, and tested status.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** operator
- **Do:** Document deployment pipeline stages with gating criteria; define rollback procedure with time target; link runbooks to specific failure modes; specify scaling triggers with thresholds; state RTO/RPO targets
- **Don't:** Describe deployment tools without procedures; state rollback as aspirational; omit time targets; leave scaling triggers vague

**Required subsections:** Deployment Automation, Rollback Procedure
**Optional subsections:** Runbooks, Scaling, Disaster Recovery, Change Management
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Component Model, Engineering(07)

---

### 11. Observability

**Template:**

```markdown
## Observability

### Telemetry Backend
[Identified backend with justification relative to scale and cost]

### Correlation ID Strategy
[How correlation IDs are generated, propagated through async boundaries, and used for request tracing]

### Log Aggregation Pipeline
[Collection, storage, retention period, access controls]

### Metrics Retention
[Retention and downsampling policy, SLO monitoring architecture]

### On-Call and Alerting
[Alert routing, on-call escalation, SLO breach notification]
```

**Correct example:**
> **Telemetry Backend**
> - Backend: OpenTelemetry Collector → ClickHouse for traces, Prometheus for metrics
> - Justification: ClickHouse handles high-cardinality trace data at scale
>
> **Correlation ID Strategy**
> - Generated: UUID v4 at system entry point
> - Propagated: X-Correlation-ID header across HTTP; embedded in event envelope for async paths
>
> **Log Aggregation Pipeline**
> - Collection: Fluentd sidecar per component
> - Storage: ClickHouse, 90-day hot retention, 1-year cold (S3)

**Incorrect example:**
> We use logs and metrics. Correlation IDs are nice to have. Retention is handled by the platform team.
> *Why wrong: lacks specific infrastructure, retention periods, and correlation strategy.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** operator
- **Do:** Identify the telemetry backend with justification; document correlation ID generation and propagation across all async boundaries; define log retention and access controls; specify SLO monitoring architecture
- **Don't:** Name tools without justification; leave correlation ID propagation implicit; omit retention periods

**Required subsections:** Telemetry Backend, Correlation ID Strategy
**Optional subsections:** Log Aggregation Pipeline, Metrics Retention, On-Call and Alerting
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Component Model, Communication, Engineering(07)
