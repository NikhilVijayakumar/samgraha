## Cross-Section Coherence Constraint

> Sourced from `audit/semantic/document/15-readme.md` Engineering Intent.

Sections within a README must describe the same project without contradicting each other. Specifically:

- Usage examples must be achievable with the Installation and Build commands provided
- Getting Started must be a linear superset of Installation + Build + Usage
- Configuration options must be consistent with what Usage examples demonstrate
- Development setup must include prerequisites listed in Installation
- Contributing must reference Development workflow and test commands
- Repository Structure must list directories that Documentation Structure references
- Project Name must match across all references (title, project name section, package manifests)

If any section would reference a command, directory, or option not present in another section, reconcile before outputting.

## Sections

---

### 1. Purpose

**Template:**

```markdown
## Purpose

This README introduces the [Project Name] repository and guides readers toward detailed documentation. It covers [scope], establishes boundaries via [out of scope], and references the broader documentation ecosystem.

> **What this README is:** [high-level summary of README's role]
> **What this README is not:** [what belongs in other documentation]
```

> **Generation note:** When generating for a specific system, fill this template with *that system's* README purpose: what this file introduces, what boundaries apply, and where readers should go for detail. The meta-level "This document defines the standard for README..." language belongs in the standard itself, not in a generated document.

**Correct example:**
> This README introduces the Acme Platform repository and guides readers toward detailed documentation. It covers project overview, setup, usage, and links to architecture, features, and engineering documentation. It does not contain feature specifications, API documentation, or implementation details.

**Incorrect example:**
> This README covers all project documentation including API references, database schemas, and deployment procedures.
> *Why wrong: Purpose section must define README scope and boundaries, not duplicate detailed documentation from other standards.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** conversational
- **Voice:** first person plural
- **Structure:** paragraphs
- **Audience:** new contributor
- **Do:** State what the README is and what it is not; reference the broader documentation ecosystem
- **Don't:** Include feature lists; duplicate content from other documentation standards; use vague scope language

---

### 2. Project Name

**Template:**

```markdown
## Project Name

[Canonical project name exactly as it appears in package manifests]
```

**Correct example:**
> Acme Platform

**Incorrect example:**
> The Acme Platform is a comprehensive project management solution.
> *Why wrong: Project Name section must state only the canonical name, not a description of the project.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** structural
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** paragraphs
- **Audience:** engineer
- **Do:** Use the exact canonical name from package manifests; verify name matches across documentation
- **Don't:** Add descriptions or taglines; abbreviate the name; use marketing or codenames

---

### 3. Short Description

**Template:**

```markdown
## Short Description

[One to two sentences stating what the project does and who it is for — under 200 characters]
```

**Correct example:**
> A lightweight task scheduler that automates data pipeline orchestration across distributed environments.

**Incorrect example:**
> Acme Scheduler is a tool built with Python 3.12, uses Apache Airflow as its backend, stores data in PostgreSQL, and supports Docker deployment. Install it with pip install acme-scheduler. It has 15 commands and supports cron expressions.
> *Why wrong: Short Description must be one to two sentences under 200 characters summarizing what the project does, not listing technology stack, installation instructions, or feature counts.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** conversational
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** paragraphs
- **Audience:** product owner
- **Do:** Write one to two sentences under 200 characters; state what the project does and who it is for
- **Don't:** Include technology stack details; mention installation steps; list feature counts or version numbers

---

### 4. Overview

**Template:**

```markdown
## Overview

[Explain the problem the project solves]
[Describe the project's approach at a high level]
[Reference Vision(01) for deeper context — no implementation details, no architecture diagrams]
```

**Correct example:**
> Managing data pipelines across multiple environments requires consistent scheduling, monitoring, and error handling. Most teams build custom scripts that become difficult to maintain.
>
> Acme Scheduler provides a declarative configuration format and built-in retry logic that lets teams define and deploy pipelines without writing orchestration code.

**Incorrect example:**
> Acme Scheduler is a Python application using the Celery task queue with Redis as a broker. It consists of a scheduler module, a task runner, and a REST API built with FastAPI.
> *Why wrong: Overview must explain the problem and solution at a high level, not describe the technology stack or internal architecture.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** inspirational
- **Voice:** third person
- **Structure:** paragraphs
- **Audience:** new contributor
- **Do:** Explain the problem the project solves; describe the approach at a high level; reference Vision for deeper context
- **Don't:** Describe the technology stack; include architecture diagrams; list implementation details or internal components

---

### 5. Key Capabilities

**Template:**

```markdown
## Key Capabilities

- [Capability 1: short descriptive phrase]
- [Capability 2: short descriptive phrase]
- [Capability 3: short descriptive phrase]
<!-- List 3 to 7 capabilities; no implementation details -->
```

**Correct example:**
> - Declarative pipeline configuration
> - Automatic retry and error recovery
> - Multi-environment deployment support
> - Built-in monitoring and alerting
> - CLI and web interface

**Incorrect example:**
> - Uses Celery 5.3.2 with Redis broker
> - Supports Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
> - Has 47 unit tests and 12 integration tests
> - Deploys via Docker Compose or Kubernetes Helm chart
> *Why wrong: Key Capabilities must list high-level capabilities as scannable phrases, not implementation details like library versions, test counts, or deployment mechanisms.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** structural
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** product owner
- **Do:** List three to seven capabilities as short descriptive phrases; keep each capability independent and scannable
- **Don't:** Include library versions or test counts; describe deployment mechanisms; use technical jargon or implementation details

---

### 6. Repository Structure

**Template:**

```markdown
## Repository Structure

- `src/` — [purpose]
- `tests/` — [purpose]
- `docs/` — [purpose]
- `scripts/` — [purpose]
<!-- High-level descriptions only; no file-level detail -->
```

**Correct example:**
> - `src/` — Application source code
> - `tests/` — Unit and integration tests
> - `docs/` — Documentation by standard
> - `scripts/` — Build and automation scripts
> - `examples/` — Usage examples and templates

**Incorrect example:**
> - `src/core/scheduler/worker.py` — The main worker loop that processes tasks
> - `src/api/routes/v2/health.py` — Health check endpoint returning 200 OK
> *Why wrong: Repository Structure must provide high-level directory descriptions, not file-level implementation details.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** structural
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** new contributor
- **Do:** List major directories with one-sentence purpose descriptions; keep descriptions high-level and focused on purpose
- **Don't:** List individual files or modules; include implementation details; describe internal code organization

---

### 7. Documentation Structure

**Template:**

```markdown
## Documentation Structure

[List documentation directories and their purpose]
[Explain the organization principle]
[Provide navigation guidance from README to detailed docs]
```

**Correct example:**
> Documentation lives under `docs/` organized by standard:
>
> - `docs/raw/vision/` — Project goals and context
> - `docs/raw/features/` — Feature specifications
> - `docs/raw/architecture/` — System design
> - `docs/raw/engineering/` — Implementation standards
>
> Start with the [Documentation Navigation](#documentation-navigation) section below for a guided reading order.

**Incorrect example:**
> All documentation is in the docs folder. There is a lot of markdown in there.
> *Why wrong: Documentation Structure must list directories with their purpose and provide navigation guidance, not vague statements about file locations.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** structural
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** new contributor
- **Do:** List documentation directories with one-sentence purpose descriptions; provide navigation guidance from README to detailed docs
- **Don't:** Omit directory purposes; list individual files; provide navigation without linking to specific standards

> ```
>
> Verify installation:
>
> ```bash
> acme-scheduler --version
> # Expected: acme-scheduler 2.1.0
> ```

**Incorrect example:**
> Just clone the repo and it works. You might need to install some things first.
> *Why wrong: Installation must provide specific step-by-step commands with prerequisites listed, not vague instructions that leave the reader guessing what to install.*

**Writing guidance:**
- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** imperative
- **Structure:** bullet lists
- **Audience:** engineer
- **Do:** List prerequisites with version numbers first; provide step-by-step commands with expected output; verify each step works
