# Rationale — Generation Template

Generate the Technology Selection (Rationale) section for an Engineering document.

## Relationships

| Relationship | Target | Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| `derives_from` | philosophy / rationale | Technology rationale must derive from the product's rationale |
| `informs` | engineering / guiding_principles | Technology rationale informs and constrains guiding principles |

## Template

```markdown
## Technology Selection

> [metadata block]

### [Technology Category]

[1 paragraph explaining why this technology was chosen, connected to architectural constraints and external context]

[repeat for each technology category: Language, Framework, Database, Tooling, etc.]
```

## Examples

**Correct:**
> **Language:** Project Alpha uses Python 3.12+ because the team has deep expertise, the ecosystem provides mature libraries for data processing, and the architecture requires rapid prototyping cycles. This choice is constrained by the organization's existing Python infrastructure (External Context) and the need for readable, maintainable code (Architecture Section 2.1).

**Incorrect:**
> **Language:** Python. **Framework:** Django. **Database:** PostgreSQL.
> *Why wrong: This is a bare list with no rationale, no connection to Architecture or External Context, and no explanation of why these technologies were chosen.*

## Writing Guidance

- **Tone:** technical
- **Voice:** third person
- **Structure:** paragraphs
- **Audience:** engineer
- **Do:** Connect every technology choice to an architectural constraint or External Context source; explain why each technology was chosen, not just what was chosen; group rationale by engineering concern.
- **Don't:** Present technology choices as bare lists without rationale; justify choices on business or trend grounds rather than engineering grounds; conflate selection rationale with implementation details.

**Required subsections:** One per technology category (Language, Framework, Database, Tooling as applicable)
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05), External Context, Constraints
