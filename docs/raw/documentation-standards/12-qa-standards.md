> **semantic_type:** `purpose`
> **scope:** [How features are verified against specifications]
> **out_of_scope:** [Implementation details, build pipelines, deployment procedures]
> **contributes:** [Provides verification layer for upstream standards]
> **relationships:** [Feature(04) defines what to test; Architecture(05) defines boundaries; ...]

[Paragraph explaining relationship to upstream documents (Feature, Architecture, Design, Security) and downstream documents (Implementation, Build)]
```

**Required subsections:** none
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Feature(04), Architecture(05), Design(06), Security(03), Implementation(13)

### Examples

**Correct:**
> This document defines how Project Nova verifies that features meet their specifications. It derives verification targets from Feature requirements, Architecture boundaries, and Security constraints. The testing strategy covers all applicable risk areas with measurable pass/fail criteria, and every test type traces back to the upstream documentation it validates.

**Incorrect:**
> This document defines the QA process for Project Nova. The team uses Jest for unit tests and Cypress for E2E tests.
> *Why wrong: This section defines verification scope and philosophy, not tool choices or implementation details. Framework selection belongs in Engineering(07), not here.*

This document defines the standard for Quality Assurance documentation within the engineering documentation ecosystem.

QA Documentation defines how features are verified against their specifications — the testing strategy, test types, and verification chain from feature requirements to implementation.

Unlike other standards that define what to build, QA defines how to verify that what was built matches what was specified.

---

## Plan Scenarios

Not every QA plan covers the entire project. The plan type depends on what is being tested and why.

### Full Generation

> **scenario:** New project or major version — define the complete test strategy for all features
> **scope:** Entire project
> **inputs:** Feature(04) requirements, Architecture(05) system boundaries, Design(06) UX, Security(03) requirements
> **outputs:** Complete QA plan covering all test types for all features, with applicability conditions

Use Full Generation when:
- Starting a new project
- Releasing a major version with significant changes
- The team needs a complete test strategy from scratch

Full Generation produces a comprehensive test strategy. All applicable test types are defined with coverage targets.

### Per Feature

> **scenario:** New feature — define QA plan for that specific feature
> **scope:** Per feature
> **inputs:** Feature(04) for the specific feature, Feature Design(09), relevant upstream docs
> **outputs:** QA plan covering applicable test types for the specific feature

Use Per Feature when:
- Adding a new feature to an existing project
- The feature has unique testing requirements
- Feature-specific test coverage needs to be defined

Per Feature produces a focused QA plan. Test types are selected based on the feature's risk profile.

### Enhancement

> **scenario:** Existing feature change — add or update tests for specific section
> **scope:** Per feature or per section (UI tests, API tests, etc.)
> **inputs:** Feature(04) updated requirements, specific upstream docs
> **outputs:** Updated test coverage for the changed feature/section

Use Enhancement when:
- Modifying an existing feature
- Adding tests for a specific section (UI, API, data layer)
- Improving test coverage for an existing area

Enhancement produces targeted test additions. Scope is limited to what changed.

### Scope Options

| Scope | When to Use | Required Inputs |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Entire project | New project or major version | All upstream docs |
| Per feature | New feature | Feature(04) + relevant upstream |
| UI section | UI/UX changes | Feature Design(09) + Design(06) |
| API section | Backend changes | Architecture(05) + Engineering(07) |
| Security section | Security-related changes | Security(03) |
| Data section | Data layer changes | Architecture(05) data flow |

---

## Test Strategy

> **semantic_type:** `test_strategy`
> **scope:** The overall testing approach — which test types apply, in what order, and with what priority
> **out_of_scope:** Specific test implementations, framework choices, CI/CD configuration
> **contributes:** Provides the testing roadmap that guides all test-related decisions
> **relationships:** Derived from Feature(04) requirements and Architecture(05) system boundaries; referenced by Implementation(13) for verification
> **responsibilities:** Define the testing pyramid appropriate for the project; specify which test types are mandatory vs. conditional
> **generation_rules:** Start from project profile (web app, CLI, ML pipeline, library); map test types to risk areas; prioritize by impact
> **enhancement_rules:** Adjust test mix as project evolves; add test types for new risk areas; remove tests for deprecated features
> **validation_rules:** Test strategy covers all applicable risk areas; priorities are justified; no gaps in verification chain
> **audit_rules:** Must exist; must define test type applicability; must reference project profile; must be justified by risk analysis

## Test Strategy

> **semantic_type:** `test_strategy`
> **scope:** [Overall testing approach — which test types apply, priority, order]
> **out_of_scope:** [Specific test implementations, framework choices, CI/CD configuration]
> **contributes:** [Provides testing roadmap for all test-related decisions]
> **relationships:** [Derived from Feature(04) and Architecture(05); referenced by Implementation(13)]
> **responsibilities:** [Define testing pyramid; specify mandatory vs. conditional test types]
> **generation_rules:** [Start from project profile; map test types to risk areas]
> **enhancement_rules:** [Adjust test mix as project evolves; add for new risk areas]

| Test Type | Applicability | Priority |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Unit Testing | [condition] | Mandatory |
| Integration Testing | [condition] | Mandatory/Conditional |
| End-to-End Testing | [condition] | Conditional |
| Smoke Testing | [condition] | Conditional |
| Load Testing | [condition] | Conditional |
| Scalability Testing | [condition] | Conditional |
| Security Testing | [condition] | Mandatory |

[Paragraph explaining the testing pyramid approach and how test types were selected based on project profile]
```

**Required subsections:** Test Type table with Applicability and Priority columns
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Feature(04), Architecture(05), Engineering(07)

### Examples

**Correct:**
> | Test Type | Applicability | Priority |
> |-----------|--------------|----------|
> | Unit Testing | All projects | Mandatory |
> | Integration Testing | Multi-component system with 4 services | Mandatory |
> | End-to-End Testing | Application has web UI | Conditional |
> | Smoke Testing | Application is deployed to production | Conditional |
> | Load Testing | Expected 500+ concurrent users | Conditional |
> | Security Testing | All projects | Mandatory |
>
> Project Profile: Web application with REST API, background workers, and PostgreSQL database. Risk areas prioritized by user-facing surface area and data sensitivity.

**Incorrect:**
> | Test Type | Applicability | Priority |
> |-----------|--------------|----------|
> | Unit Testing | Yes | High |
> | Integration Testing | Yes | High |
> | E2E Testing | Yes | High |
>
> We will test everything because all tests are important.
> *Why wrong: Applicability must state WHEN a test type applies (a condition), not just "Yes." Priority must use the standard scale (Mandatory/Conditional), not adjectives. The strategy must be justified by project profile and risk analysis.*

Every QA document must define the overall test strategy before individual test types. The strategy maps test types to project needs.

| Test Type | Applicability | Priority |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Unit Testing | All projects | Mandatory |
| Integration Testing | Projects with multiple components | Mandatory |
| End-to-End Testing | Applications with user-facing interfaces | Conditional |
| Smoke Testing | Deployed applications | Conditional |
| Load Testing | Applications expecting concurrent users | Conditional |
| Scalability Testing | Applications expecting growth | Conditional |
| Security Testing | All projects | Mandatory |

Section headings are case-insensitive. Sections not listed here are stored as `generic` type — preserved but not queryable by type.

## Unit Testing

> **semantic_type:** `unit_testing`
> **scope:** Testing individual components or functions in isolation — the foundation of the testing pyramid
> **out_of_scope:** Integration between components, user-facing behavior, performance characteristics
> **contributes:** Verifies that individual building blocks work correctly before they are composed
> **relationships:** Validates Feature(04) functional requirements at the component level; references Engineering(07) code standards for test quality
> **responsibilities:** Define unit test coverage targets, naming conventions, and assertion standards
> **generation_rules:** Derive from Feature(04) functional requirements; test one behavior per test; follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
> **enhancement_rules:** Add tests for new behaviors; update tests when behavior changes; remove tests for deleted features
> **validation_rules:** Coverage targets are defined; naming conventions are explicit; assertion standards are clear
> **audit_rules:** Must exist; must define coverage targets; must not test implementation details; must test behavior, not structure

|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Line coverage | [X%] | [Tool] |
| Branch coverage | [X%] | [Tool] |
| Function coverage | [X%] | [Tool] |

### Conventions

- **Naming:** [pattern, e.g., `test_<unit>_<scenario>_<expected>`]
- **Pattern:** Arrange-Act-Assert
- **One assertion per behavior**
```

**Required subsections:** Coverage Targets table
**Optional subsections:** Conventions
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Feature(04), Engineering(07)

### Examples

**Correct:**

> |--------|--------|-------------------|
> | Line coverage | 80% | ProjectNova test runner |
> | Branch coverage | 75% | ProjectNova test runner |

>
> ### Conventions
>
> - **Naming:** `test_<unit>_<scenario>_<expected>`
> - **Pattern:** Arrange-Act-Assert
> - **One assertion per behavior**

**Incorrect:**
> Unit tests should cover most of the code. The team writes unit tests for all new features and fixes.
> *Why wrong: Coverage targets must be measurable with explicit percentages and a defined measurement method. Vague statements like "most of the code" or "all new features" cannot be audited or verified.*

Unit testing is applicable to all projects. Define coverage targets appropriate to the project's risk profile.

### Integration Boundaries

| Boundary | Components | Contract | Verification Method |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| [Boundary 1] | [Component A ↔ Component B] | [API/Protocol] | [Test approach] |
| [Boundary 2] | [Component B ↔ Component C] | [API/Protocol] | [Test approach] |

[Diagram showing component boundaries and communication paths]
```

**Required subsections:** Integration Boundaries table
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** Component diagram showing integration boundaries
**Required cross-references:** Architecture(05), Feature(04)

### Examples

> | Worker Queue ↔ Processing Service | Queue ↔ Worker | Message schema v2 | Contract test with fixture messages |
>
> [Diagram showing the three component boundaries and their communication paths]

**Incorrect:**
> We test that the API works with the database and the cache. All services communicate over HTTP.
> *Why wrong: Integration boundaries must be explicitly listed as a table mapping specific component pairs, their contracts, and verification methods. Vague descriptions of "services communicating" don't define testable boundaries.*

Integration testing is mandatory for projects with multiple components. Map test coverage to Architecture(05) component boundaries.

### Critical User Journeys

| Journey | Design Reference | Expected Outcome | Pass/Fail Criteria |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| [Journey 1] | Design(06) §[section] | [Expected result] | [Measurable criteria] |
| [Journey 2] | Design(06) §[section] | [Expected result] | [Measurable criteria] |

```

**Required subsections:** Critical User Journeys table
**Optional subsections:** none

### Examples

**Correct:**
> ### Critical User Journeys

> | Journey | Design Reference | Expected Outcome | Pass/Fail Criteria |
> |---------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
> | New user registration | Design(06) §Onboarding Flow | User receives confirmation email within 60s; profile created in database | HTTP 200 response; email sent; DB row exists |
> | Complete purchase | Design(06) §Checkout | Order created; payment processed; confirmation displayed | Order ID returned; payment status "success"; confirmation page renders |
>
> [Flowchart showing happy path and critical edge cases for registration and checkout]

**Incorrect:**
> Test that users can log in, add items to cart, and check out. Make sure the UI works.
> *Why wrong: Critical user journeys must be mapped to specific Design(06) references with explicit expected outcomes and measurable pass/fail criteria. Generic descriptions without traceability to design docs cannot be verified or audited.*

End-to-end testing is conditional — required for applications with user-facing interfaces. Map test coverage to Design(06) user workflows.

## Smoke Testing

> **semantic_type:** `smoke_testing`
> **scope:** Quick sanity checks after deployment — verifying the application starts and core functions work
> **out_of_scope:** Deep functional testing, performance testing, edge case validation
> **contributes:** Provides the first line of defense after deployment; catches critical failures before users do
> **relationships:** References Implementation(13) deployed artifacts; validates Build(14) deployment output
> **responsibilities:** Define smoke test scope (what "core functions" means), pass/fail criteria, and execution timing
> **generation_rules:** Start from the most critical user journey; test that the application starts; verify core data flows
> **enhancement_rules:** Add smoke tests for new critical paths; update when core functions change; keep the suite fast
> **validation_rules:** Smoke tests are fast (< 5 minutes); cover critical paths; have clear pass/fail criteria

### Core Functions

- [ ] Application starts successfully
- [ ] [Core function 1] responds correctly
- [ ] [Core function 2] responds correctly
- [ ] Database connectivity verified
- [ ] Authentication endpoint responds

**Maximum execution time:** [X minutes]
**Pass criteria:** All checks pass
**Fail criteria:** Any check fails
```

**Required subsections:** Core Functions checklist
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Implementation(13), Build(14)

### Examples

**Correct:**
> ### Core Functions
>
> - [ ] Application starts and responds on port 8080
> - [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200 OK
> - [ ] Database connection pool initializes (max 10 connections)
> - [ ] Authentication endpoint accepts valid credentials
> - [ ] Primary API endpoint returns expected response schema
>
> **Maximum execution time:** 3 minutes
> **Pass criteria:** All checks pass
> **Fail criteria:** Any check fails — block deployment rollback

**Incorrect:**
> Smoke test: make sure the app works. Check that users can log in and the dashboard loads.
> *Why wrong: Smoke tests require a structured checklist of core functions with pass/fail criteria and a maximum execution time. Unstructured descriptions without timing constraints cannot function as deployment gates.*

Smoke testing is conditional — required for deployed applications. Must be fast enough to run after every deployment.

**Required subsections:** Load Profiles table, Performance Targets table
**Optional subsections:** none

### Examples

**Correct:**

> | Error rate | < 0.5% | Application logs |

**Incorrect:**
> The app should be fast. We expect it to handle many users without slowing down.
> *Why wrong: Load testing requires specific numerical profiles (concurrent user counts, durations, response times) and measurable performance targets. Qualitative descriptions like "fast" and "many users" cannot be tested or verified.*

Load testing is conditional — required for applications expecting concurrent users. Define realistic load profiles based on expected usage.

> | Scenario | Load Multiplier | Expected Behavior | Breaking Point | Scaling Strategy |
> |----------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
> | Moderate growth | 2x baseline | Response time increases < 20% | N/A | Horizontal pod autoscaling |
> | Significant growth | 5x baseline | Response time increases < 50% | 8x — connection pool exhaustion | Add read replicas + connection pooling |
> | Extreme growth | 10x baseline | Graceful degradation with queuing | 15x — message queue overflow | Rate limiting + queue partitioning |
>
> ### Breaking Points
>
> | Component | Breaking Point | Failure Mode | Recovery Strategy |
> |-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
> | Database connection pool | 800 connections | New connections rejected | Drain idle connections; scale read replicas |
> | Message queue | 100k pending messages | Messages dropped after 1h TTL | Increase consumer count; archive old messages |

**Incorrect:**
> The system should scale to handle more users as we grow. We will add servers when needed.
> *Why wrong: Scalability testing requires defined growth scenarios with specific load multipliers, expected behaviors, and documented breaking points. Statements about future intent don't characterize how the system actually behaves under growth pressure.*

Scalability testing is conditional — required for applications expecting significant growth. Document where the system breaks and how it scales.

### Security Test Types

| Test Type | Threat Category Coverage | Tool | Frequency | Severity Threshold |
|-----------|------------------------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| SAST | [categories] | [Tool] | [frequency] | [Critical/High/Medium] |
| DAST | [categories] | [Tool] | [frequency] | [Critical/High/Medium] |
| Dependency scanning | [categories] | [Tool] | [frequency] | [Critical/High/Medium] |
| Secrets detection | [categories] | [Tool] | [frequency] | [Critical/High/Medium] |

### Severity Thresholds

| Severity | Fail Build? | Required Response Time | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------------------|----------|
| Critical | Yes | [X hours] | [Examples] |
| High | Yes | [X days] | [Examples] |
| Medium | No | [X days] | [Examples] |
| Low | No | [X sprints] | [Examples] |
```

**Required subsections:** Security Test Types table, Severity Thresholds table
**Optional subsections:** none
**Required diagrams:** none
**Required cross-references:** Security(03), Engineering(07), Implementation(13)

### Examples

**Correct:**
> ### Security Test Types
>
> | Test Type | Threat Category Coverage | Tool | Frequency | Severity Threshold |
> |-----------|------------------------|------|-----------|-------------------|
> | SAST | Injection, XSS, insecure deserialization | Static analyzer | Every commit | Critical |
> | DAST | Authentication bypass, privilege escalation | DAST scanner | Nightly build | Critical |
> | Dependency scanning | Known CVEs in third-party packages | Dependency checker | Daily | High |
> | Secrets detection | Hardcoded credentials, API keys | Secret scanner | Every commit | Critical |
>
> ### Severity Thresholds
>
> | Severity | Fail Build? | Required Response Time | Examples |
> |----------|------------|----------------------|----------|
> | Critical | Yes | 4 hours | Remote code execution, SQL injection |
> | High | Yes | 24 hours | Authentication bypass, privilege escalation |
> | Medium | No | 7 days | Information disclosure, missing security headers |
> | Low | No | Next sprint | Verbose error messages, outdated TLS version |

**Incorrect:**
> Run security scans and fix any issues found. Use whatever security tools the team prefers.
> *Why wrong: Security testing requires explicit test types mapped to threat categories, a defined tool, scan frequency, and severity thresholds that determine build pass/fail. Generic directives without measurable thresholds cannot be audited.*

Security testing is mandatory for all projects. Map test coverage to Security(03) threat categories. Severity thresholds determine pass/fail.

## Required Sections

Every QA document must contain the following sections.
Sections are identified by heading text; the compiler maps each to a semantic type.

| Section | semantic_type | Required | Aliases | Content Requirements |
|---------|--------------|----------|---------|----------------------|
| Test Strategy | `test_strategy` | ✓ | Testing Strategy, QA Strategy | Test type applicability table with priority levels; project profile mapping; risk-based justification |
| Unit Testing | `unit_testing` | ✓ | Unit Tests, Component Tests | Coverage targets; naming conventions; assertion standards; Arrange-Act-Assert pattern |

Section headings are case-insensitive. Sections not listed here are stored as `generic` type — preserved but not queryable by type.

---

## Goals

A QA document aims to:

* Define which test types are needed for the project
* Specify applicability conditions so teams know what applies
* Create a verification chain from Feature(04) requirements to Implementation(13)
* Define measurable pass/fail criteria for each test type
* Guide test infrastructure investment based on risk

---

## Non-Goals

QA Documentation does not define:

* Test implementation details or framework choices
* CI/CD pipeline configuration
* Deployment procedures
* Release management processes
* Bug tracking or issue management

These responsibilities belong to Engineering(07) and Build(14).

---

## Success Criteria

QA Documentation is successful when:

* Every applicable test type has clear coverage targets
* The verification chain from requirements to implementation is complete
* Pass/fail criteria are measurable and automated where possible
* Test strategy evolves with the project without becoming outdated
* Teams know exactly which tests to write and why

---

## Responsibilities

QA Documentation is responsible for defining:

* Which test types apply to the project
* What each test type verifies against upstream documentation
* Coverage targets and pass/fail criteria
* The verification chain from requirements to implementation
* How test results map to documentation compliance

QA defines the verification contract. Implementation fulfills it. Build validates it.

---

## Scope

QA Documentation may describe:

* Test strategy and test type applicability
* Unit test coverage targets and conventions
* Integration test boundaries and contract verification
* End-to-end test scenarios and acceptance criteria
* Smoke test scope and execution timing
* Load test profiles and performance targets
* Scalability test growth scenarios and breaking points
* Security test coverage and severity thresholds

---

## Out of Scope

QA Documentation must not describe:

* Product vision or strategy
* Architecture or system design
* Implementation details or code structure
* Build pipeline configuration
* Deployment procedures
* Release management

These belong to their own documentation standards.

---

## Inputs

QA Documentation derives from:

* Feature(04) — what to verify
* Architecture(05) — system boundaries and component model
* Design(06) — user experience to validate
* Engineering(07) — test infrastructure and code standards
* External Context(08) — external testing constraints
* Security(03) — security test requirements
* Implementation(13) — what was actually built (as-built verification)

---

## Outputs

QA Documentation provides direction for:

* Test implementation and execution
* Build(14) test pipeline configuration
* Implementation(13) verification records
* Security(03) compliance verification

---

## Traceability

```text
Feature(04) ──── defines what to test
Architecture(05) ── defines system boundaries for testing
Design(06) ──────── defines UX to validate
Engineering(07) ─── defines test infrastructure
External Context(08) ─ defines external test constraints
Security(03) ────── defines security test requirements
       ↓
  QA(12) ──────── defines testing strategy and verification chain
       ↓
  Implementation(13) ── gets tested against QA(12) contract
       ↓
  Build(14) ────── validates test results in pipeline
```

---

## Relationships

| Document | Relationship |
|---|---|
| Feature(04) | Defines what QA verifies |
| Architecture(05) | Defines system boundaries for test scope |
| Design(06) | Defines UX workflows for E2E testing |
| Engineering(07) | Provides test infrastructure standards |
| External Context(08) | Provides external testing constraints |
| Security(03) | Defines security test requirements |
| Implementation(13) | Is what QA tests against |
| Build(14) | Validates QA results in pipeline |

---

## Required Characteristics

QA Documentation should be:

* Risk-driven — test types prioritized by impact
* Measurable — coverage targets and pass/fail criteria are quantifiable
* Applicable — test types have clear applicability conditions
* Traceable — every test type maps to upstream documentation
* Evolving — test strategy grows with the project

---

## Audit Rules

| ID | Check | Severity |
|----|-------|----------|
| `qa-001` | Has test strategy | error |
| `qa-002` | Test strategy defines applicability conditions | error |
| `qa-003` | Unit testing section exists | error |
| `qa-004` | Security testing section exists | error |
| `qa-005` | Integration testing section exists (multi-component projects) | warning |
| `qa-006` | Each test type references upstream documentation | error |
| `qa-007` | Coverage targets are measurable | error |
| `qa-008` | Pass/fail criteria are defined | error |

---

## Validation Rules

QA Documentation is considered valid when:

* Test strategy defines which test types apply
* Each applicable test type has measurable coverage targets
* Every test type references the upstream documentation it verifies
* Pass/fail criteria are explicit and automatable
* The verification chain is complete from requirements to implementation
* Security testing covers all Security(03) threat categories

---

## Generation Rules

When generating QA Documentation:

* Start from Feature(04) requirements — what needs to be verified
* Map test types to project profile (web app, CLI, ML pipeline, library)
* Define applicability conditions for each test type
* Create verification chain from test types to upstream documentation
* Set measurable coverage targets based on risk profile
* Define pass/fail criteria that can be automated

---

## Enhancement Rules

When enhancing QA Documentation:

* Add test types when new risk areas emerge
* Update coverage targets as project maturity increases
* Remove tests for deprecated features
* Improve test strategy alignment with current project profile
* Preserve the verification chain when upstream documentation changes

---

## Summary

QA Documentation is the verification layer of the documentation ecosystem. It defines which tests to write, what they verify, and how to know when the implementation is correct. Every test type maps to upstream documentation — Feature requirements, Architecture boundaries, Design workflows, Engineering standards, and Security requirements. The test strategy is risk-driven and project-specific: not every test type applies to every project, but every project needs a clear verification contract.

---

## Common Mistakes

Examples of incorrect QA content include:

* Defining test implementations instead of test contracts
* Skipping applicability conditions — assuming all test types apply everywhere
* No verification chain — tests exist but don't trace to requirements
* Coverage targets without measurement method
* Security testing as an afterthought instead of mandatory
* Defining CI/CD pipeline details instead of test strategy

---

## Documentation Folder

QA documents live under:

```text
docs/raw/qa/
```

---

## Usage

Written when the project's testing strategy is defined or changes; read by anyone writing tests or configuring test pipelines. Use `samgraha compile --domain qa` to validate structure, and `samgraha audit --domain qa` to verify the test strategy covers all applicable risk areas.
